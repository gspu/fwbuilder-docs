          <para>If you have interfaces with a dynamic address or a
          point-to-point address and you try to insert a routing rule
          for the default gateway, compilation might fail, stating
          "gateway not reachable". Typically this is the case for DSL
          dial-up links. Solution: leave the gateway field empty.
          Just specify the interface.</para>
