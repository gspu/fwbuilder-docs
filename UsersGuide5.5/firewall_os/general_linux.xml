    <title>Generic Linux OS</title>

    <para>
      A script generated by Firewall Builder for a generic Linux
      firewall has a standard structure
      per <ulink url="http://refspecs.freestandards.org/LSB_3.1.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic.html#INISCRPTACT">LSB
      ("Linux Standard Base Core Specification 3.1")</ulink>. The
      script supports command-line
      arguments <emphasis>"start"</emphasis>, <emphasis>"stop"</emphasis>,
      <emphasis>"status"</emphasis>, <emphasis>"reload"</emphasis>. In
      addition to these, it also understands
      arguments <emphasis>"interfaces"</emphasis>
      and <emphasis>"test_interfaces"</emphasis>. The script can be
      placed in the /etc/init.d/ directory among other initialization
      scripts; however, at this time this is not the default. The
      script does not have standard "INIT INFO" header for the
      chkconfig (or similar) utility. Mostly, this is because different
      Linux distributions use slightly different format of this header
      and different utilities to manage start-up scripts and Firewall
      Builder does not yet allow the user to specify which Linux
      distribution is running on the firewall machine. This support may
      improve in the future.

      methods of making the firewall script installed by Firewall
      Builder run at the system start-up.

      The generated script is assembled from parts defined in configlets
      located
      in <emphasis>/usr/share/fwbuilder-4.0.0/configlets/linux24/script_skeleton</emphasis>.
      You can modify it following instructions in
      <xref linkend="configlets"/>.
