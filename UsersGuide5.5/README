to compile the Guide on Ubuntu, I install the following packages. Some
of them may be redundant or unnecessary


docbook               - standard SGML representation system for technical documents             
docbook-dsssl         - modular DocBook DSSSL stylesheets, for print and HTML                   
docbook-utils         - Convert Docbook files to other formats (HTML, RTF, PS, man, PDF)        
docbook-xml           - standard XML documentation system, for software and systems             
docbook-xsl           - - stylesheets for processing DocBook XML to various output formats
docbook-xsl-doc-html  - stylesheets for processing DocBook XML files (HTML documentation)       
docbook-xsl-doc-pdf   - stylesheets for processing DocBook XML files (PDF documentation)        
xsltproc              - XSLT command line processor
fop                   - XML to PDF Translator

  
On Mac OS X install the following ports:

docbook-xml
docbook-xml-4.5
docbook-xsl 
docbook-dsssl  (I am not sure if this one is really needed)
fop



Stylesheets:

 html.xsl used to generate HTML output
 fo.xsl used to generate FO output, suitable for conversion to PDF with fop



Tables

how to set table column width

there is no good portable way to do this. CALS proportional measures
for column width works with printable output (PDF) but do not work
with HTML. Percents work for HTML but not for print.

Proportional measures can work with Xalan and SAxon XSLT processors
when addional extension is installed, but I could not find good
configuration for Xalan that would work on both Ubuntu and Mac. I
haven't tried Saxon.

HTML stylesheets from docbook actually copy values defined in colwidth
attribute through to HTML as "width" attribute of the <col> tag of the
generated <table>.  They do not copy proportional measures but copy
anything else.

Percents work  well for HTML but do not work at all for the print output.

Points (pt) seem to work for both HTML and print outputs. Be careful
choosing width in pt because browser can expand columns if the width
is too small but they come out crowded in print output. 20pt is enough
for the word "yes" but not enough for "Cisco".
