    <para>
      The management workstation runs fwbuilder, so it needs X11 and
      all other libraries fwbuilder depends upon. Follow Installation
      instructions in <xref linkend="install" /> to install fwbuilder
      on the machine. Start fwbuilder by
      typing <command>"fwbuilder"</command> at a shell prompt to test
      it.

      Once you get the Firewall Builder GUI up and running on the
      management workstation, you need to build a firewall policy and,
      eventually, compile it and install on the firewall. Other
      sections of this Guide describe all steps of this
      process. Configuration of the built-in policy installer and
      different ways to use it to install and activate generated
      policy on the dedicated firewall can be found in
      <xref linkend="compile-install-detail" />.
