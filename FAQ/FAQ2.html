>	Firewall Builder consists of an object-oriented GUI and a set
	of policy compilers for various firewall platforms. In
	Firewall Builder, a firewall policy is a set of rules; each
	rule consists of abstract objects that represent real network
	objects and services (hosts, routers, firewalls, networks,
	protocols). Firewall Builder helps users maintain a database
	of objects and allows policy editing using simple
	drag-and-drop operations.
      </P
><P
>	Object databases are stored in XML format.  The GUI and policy
	compilers are completely independent. The GUI requires only
	minimal changes in order to add support for a new firewall
	platform even though a new policy compiler must be
	written. This provides for a consistent abstract model and the
	same GUI for different firewall platforms. Standardized XML
	data format opens possibility for many user interfaces and
	policy compiler implementations, all interchangeable.
      </P
><P
>	We have policy compilers for the popular free firewalls
	iptables (<A
HREF="http://www.iptables.org/"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.iptables.org/</A
>),
	ipfilter (<A
HREF="http://coombs.anu.edu.au/~avalon/"

	pf (<A
HREF="http://www.benzedrine.cx/pf.html"
TARGET="_top"
>http://www.benzedrine.cx/pf.html</A
>), as well as for
	Cisco PIX and FWSM and IOS access lists.  Because of the
	modular architecture, the same Firewall Builder instance can
	be used to manage firewalls built on a variety of platforms.
      </P

> </B
>            Firewall Builder GUI is an X application, that is, it
            needs X server to display it on the screen. The program
            determines how to connect to the X server using
            environment variable DISPLAY; you probably do not have
            this environment variable if you get an error like
            that. The simplest way to avoid this problem is to start
            fwbuilder from the shell window in Gnome or KDE
            environment.
	  </P
><P
>            It may also be that the environment variable DISPLAY is
            set, but the program fwbuilder can not connect to the X
            server. In this situation you won't be able to run any
            application using X, check if that's the case by trying to
            start "xclock". This may be happening because of many
            different reasons, such as X server is not running, X
            authenitcation failure, or DISPLAY variable reassigned its
            value by the shell login script or many others. This
            problem falls outside the scope of this document, please
            search on the Internet for the answer. Here are few URLs

>            The option "Assume firewall is any" is needed for those

            the firewall use different syntax or different
            commands. Currently two plaforms require and use this
            option: iptables and Cisco PIX.
          </P
><P
>            In iptables, rules controlling access to the firewall
            should go into INPUT chain (or rules controlling packets
            originated on the firewall should go to OUTPUT chain),
            while rules that control traffic going through the
            firewall go into the FORWARD chain. Generally, a rule may
            yield code for either chain depending on the addresses
            used in SRC and DST. If address used in DST matches one of
            the addresses of the firewall, then code goes into INPUT
            chain. There are two ways to interpret "any" though. We
            can say that "any" means anything, including the
            firewall. In this case this rule should put code into both
            INPUT and FORWARD chain. If we do not assume that firewall
            is part of any, then the generated code goes only into the
            FORWARD chain.

          </P
><P
>            The script sets default policy in all chains to "DROP"
            before it clears all the rules. This is necessary because
            firewall and possibly machines behind it become wide open
            as soon as script clears the policy. Script needs to wipe
            out old rules before it installs new ones, so setting
            default policy to DROP is the only way to ensure there is
            no time window during which firewall does not offer any
            protection. One may argue that this window is really
            short, because script immediately loads new rules, but
            this is not always so. What if some rule contained an
            error and did not load? What if script has been
            interrupted and did not activate whole bunch of rules? In
            the end, it is always better to block access and thus
            prevent potential security problems, even if this comes at
            a price of some inconvenience.

>            This happens when you are using an option "Create virtual

            compiler needs to be able to determine interface of the
            firewall to assign virtual address to. In order to do that
            it scans all interfaces trying to find subnet requested NAT
            address is on. Sometimes firewall's interface has an address
            which belongs to a different network than NAT address
            specified in the rule; in this case compiler can not
            identify an interface and aborts.
          </P
><P
>            The NAT rule still can be built without "-i" or "-o" option,

            impossible. You need to turn off option "Create virtual
            addresses for NAT rules" in the tab "Firewall" of firewall
            dialog and configure this address manually.

>            This option was added by popular request, it copies .fwb
            file over to the same directory on the firewall alongside
            with generated firewall script. Many people, it seems, use
            this as a simple way to create a backup copy of their data
            file so they can easily restore it if their management
            workstation crashes. This can also be useful if they want
            to quickly roll back to the version of the data file that
            was used to generate firewall script running on the
            firewall.
          </P
><P
>            I would like to point out that this feature should be used
            carefully. This option (making a backup copy of fwb file
            on the firewall itself) makes sense when fwbuilder is used
            to manage only one firewall, and especially when the GUI
            runs on the firewall itself which means the fwb file is
            already present on the machine. However, this option may
            turn into potential problem if fwbuilder is used to manage
            multiple firewalls and all the objects and configurations
            are kept in the same fwb file residing on the remote
            workstation. If the fwb file was copied to every firewall
            as part of installation, each firewall would end up
            holding information about policy of every other
            firewall. This elevates risk in case of break-in into one
            of the firewall and should be avoided.
          </P
><P
>            Fwbuilder is not really a backup tool, and copying the
            data file over to the firewall has its drawbacks. Please
            consider making regular backups of the data file using
            other means.
          </P
><P
>            Built-in revision control system (RCS) in the Firewall
            Builder GUI allows administrator to maintain versioning of
            their data file. It is a good practice to check the file
            in (with appropriate log record) after every significant
            change is made to objects or rules. This provides a way
            for simple roll-back in the future if needed. Using RCS
            does not eliminate the need to make backups.

>            This actually represent a problem for fwbuilder. I would
            like to avoid having to write extensive GUI to let user
            choose which modules they want to load. One of the reasons
            is that the GUI may be working on one machine, while
            generated firewall script will be executed on another.  In
            this situation the GUI can not determine which modules are
            available on the firewall. Currently generated script
            simply tries to load all modules but it aborts if it
            detects an error in the command that does it (modprobe).
          </P
><P
>            Until better solution is found, you would probably need to
            remove module that conflicts with others or disable
            feature that makes generated script load modules and write
            your own script to load modules you need. You can for
            example add commands to load modules explicitly to the
            "prolog" section of the generated script.

>Open one file in the Firewall Builder GUI, then use
          main menu function "File/Import library" to import other

><P
>Note that the program identifies objects by their
          iternal unique IDs rather than by name. This means two
          objects can have the same name, which is probably
          inconvenient and should be avoided, but is not at problem
          per se. On the other hand, if you happen to have objects
          with the same ID in two data files, you can not import one
          such file into another. In fact, if you try to do that, the
          program will detect the conflict and present you with a
          dialog asking you to choose which object of the two you want
          to keep. This may be a problem if these two objects have
          different parameters (such as for example two network
          objects with the same ID but different IP
          address). Situation like this may happen if you make a copy
          of the data file and continue working with both the original
          and the copy, making changes to objects in both. With time,
          two files will probaly drift apart and at some point it will
          become impossible to merge them back. Such "forking" of the
          data files should be avoided.

>Some time ago, when I've got a new firewall that I
          needed to configure, I created a copy of my data file and
          started managing my second firewall using this file. I
          continued to manage my original firewall using my old file,
          too. Now I want to merge these two files to be able to
          manage both firewalls from one file. How can I do
          this?</P

>As described in the previous question, the program
          identifies objects by their internal unique IDs. If you make
          a copy of the data file, you create copies of all objects it
          contains. Copies inherit IDs of the original objects, this
          means you now have two data files, each of which has objects
          with the same ID. If you now make any change to an object in
          one of these files, changing its parameter, you create
          potential conflict in case you want to merge these two files
          together in the future. It is not recommended to make such
          "forks" of the data files. You can create many firewall
          objects in the same file and manage multiple firewalls that
          way. There should be no reason to work with two distinct
          copies of the same data file. </P
><P
>However if this happened and you want to merge such
          conflicting files, use main menu function "Tools/Find
          Conflicting Objects in Two Data Files" to find all conflicts
          before you try to merge. This function lets you open two
          data files and finds all objects that have the same ID but
          different other attributes. It shows you such objects side
          by side and in the end can generate a report and save it in
          a text file. The procedure is as follows:

                  on. All this should be cleaned up.</P
><P
>You may either fix addresses / ports and so on
                  if they have been changed by mistake, or create new
                  objects with different names and parameters as
                  appropriate and use them in rules. If you need to
                  replace objects, use Find/Replace function. You can
                  create new object by duplicating the old one.
                  Duplicate creates new object with different ID but
                  the same parameters. Note that rules will still
                  point at the old object, you need to use
                  Find/Replace to make them point at the new one.</P

>If you have firewall objects in the copy files
                  that were created by editing the same original object,
                  it likely they eded up with the same ID as well. These
                  need to be recreated to make them different. The
                  simplest way is to duplicate them and delete the
                  original.</P
