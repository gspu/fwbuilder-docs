      <title>Installing FreeBSD and OpenBSD Ports</title>

      <para>Firewall Builder consists of two
      ports: <filename>/usr/ports/security/libfwbuilder</filename>
      and <filename>/usr/ports/security/fwbuilder</filename>. Once
      both ports are updated (which typically takes two to three weeks after the package is released),
      simply install the
      port as usual using <filename>portinstall</filename> or issuing the "make install" command
      in <filename>/usr/ports/security/fwbuilder</filename>.</para>
