    One of the fundamental principles on which Firewall Builder is
    based is that it does not aim at just supporting one particular
    firewall platform. Since the goal is to be able to generate
    configuration for many different firewalls from the same
    representation in the GUI, Firewall Builder works with an abstract
    high level model of a firewall which incorporates features found
    in all target firewalls. In other words, Firewall Builder is not
    another iptables GUI, or PF GUI, or PIX GUI. Firewall Builder
    works with a firewall that is neither one of these, and yet at the
    same time it is all of them combined. It has useful features found
    in all of the target platforms. If a feature that it implements is
    not supported in some target firewall, it tries to emulate it (if
    possible) to make it look like that target does support it.

    Target firewalls sometimes differ in the very fundamental
    principles of operation. This can make managing policies in the
    multi-vendor environment challenging. For example, most of the
    platforms supported by fwbuilder process rules top-down, with the
    first matching rule making decision and stopping
    processing. However PF by default does it in the opposite way,
    with each matching rule not stopping processing and the last one
    making final decision. There is no "right" way of doing this, but
    if an administrator is used to some method, it is hard to switch
    back and forth while managing different firewalls. Another example
    of similar discrepancy is the order in which access control and
    nat rules work on a packet. Most firewalls supported by fwbuilder
    do nat first, so that access control rules "see" translated
    addresses in the packet. PIX, on the other hand, does it in the
    opposite order, with access control rules working on the packet
    before nat.

    Since Firewall Builder works with an abstract firewall, all these
    discrepancies go away and administrator always sees consistent
    model regardless of the choosen target firewall platform. For PIX,
    the program can make it look like NAT is done after access control
    rules (but this is optional). For PF, the program always uses PF
    option that switches it to the non-default "first match" behavior.
    In the end, the program takes care of translating the firewall
    model it presents to the user into configuration of the actual
    target firewall.

    That said, policy rules described in this article will look very
    familiar to anyone who ever worked with Firewall-1, PIX, iptables,
    PF and so on. These rules are just generalization of the ideas and
    features found in all of those firewalls. The GUI helps
    administrator create and manage rule sets and policy compilers
    then translate them into configuration language of the chosen
    target firewall platform.
