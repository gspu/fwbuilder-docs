  <a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org">Firewall Builder</a> is available
  from the <b>libfwbuilder</b> and <b>fwbuilder</b> packages in both
  Debian and Ubuntu in Universe. Packages for the current development
  builds are available from the project download area on

  Firewall Builder is a GUI firewall configuration and management tool
  that supports <em>iptables (netfilter), ipfilter, pf, ipfw, Cisco
  PIX (FWSM, ASA) and Cisco routers extended access lists</em>. Both
  network administrators and hobbyists managing firewalls with
  policies more complex that is allowed by simple web based UI can
  simplify management tasks with the application. The program can
  manage both local and remote firewalls.
</p>

<p>
  Firewall Builder can generate configuration file for any supported
  target firewall platform from the same policy created in its
  GUI. This provides for both consistent policy management solution
  for heterogeneous environments and possible migration path.
</p>

<p>
  All configuration management operations can be performed from one
  central place, Firewall Builder GUI. You can create configuration,
  track its changes using built-in revision control system and deploy
  it to one or several firewall machines. Yet, it creates
  configuration for all supported firewall platforms in their standard
  format, which makes it easy to integrate with existing automation
  scripts.
</p>

<p>
  Firewall Builder implements many best practices in firewall policy
  design and firewall management procedures. Here are some examples:
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>It enforces policy structure that denies all traffic by
      default and only permits what is necessary.</li>

    <li>Administrator can easily define ip address of the management
      workstation and Firewall Builder will automatically add rule to
      ensure that ssh access from it to the firewall is always
      permitted. This rule is designed to assure that ssh session over
      which installer activates new policy does not break or
      hang. This helps avoid accidents when errors in the policy rules
      cut remote access to the firewall off in the middle of
      activation, making it impossible to fix the error and causing
      prolonged network outage.</li>

    <li>For Cisco PIX (ASA) and IOS access lists, where each
      access-list commands are immediately activated as they are
      entered, Firewall Builder can optionally create temporary access
      list to ensure uninterrupted ssh access from the management
      workstation to the firewall for the duration of the policy
      reload session. This method provides the best protection against
      outages caused by loss of contact with the firewall because of
      errors in policy.</li>

    <li>For iptables, Firewall Builder can generate script using
      iptables-restore for atomic activation. If iptables-resore
      detects an error in the script and refuses to load policy,
      script leaves the firewall in the state it was in before. For
      other firewall platforms it uses appropriate activation methods
      to achieve the same goal.</li>

    <li>Built-in policy installer supports "test" install mode with
      automatic roll-back. This is another safety mechanism that helps
      minimize outages in case of errors in the policy. These mearures
      are available for all supported systems, such as linux/iptables,
      *BSD/pf, Cisco PIX and Cisco IOS.</li>
  </ul>
</p>

<p>
  Firewall Builder helps administrator manage many firewalls using the
  same network object database. Change made to an object is
  immediately reflected in the policy of all firewalls using this
  object. Administrator only needs to recompile and install policies
  on actual firewall machines.  This object-oriented approach
  simplifies policy design and management for both dedicated firewalls
  and on-server firewalls. This aids in implementaion of security in
  depth.
</p>

<p>
  Built-in interactive installer uses ssh to communicated with the
  firewall and can automatically copy generated policy and activate
  it. Installer supports batch mode of operation and can update policy
  on multiple firewalls in one session.
</p>

<p>
  In Firewall Builder, administrator works with an abstraction of
  firewall policy and NAT rules; software effectively
  &quot;hides&quot; specifics of particular target firewall platform
  and helps administrator focus on implementation of security
  policy. Backend software components, or policy compilers, can
  determine many parameters of policy rules using information
  available through network and service objects and therefore generate
  fairly complex code for the target firewall, relieving administrator
  from having to remember all its details and limitations.
</p>

<p>
  Policy compilers also run sanity checks on firewall rules and make
  sure typical errors are caught before generated policy is
  deployed.
</p>

<p>
  Here is a brief introduction to Firewall Builder. We are going to
  build very simple firewall policy to protect a desktop machine but
  permit ssh access to it in just a few steps. This demonstration
  covers the whole process starting with launching the program for the
  first time all the way through to the point where newly created
  iptables policy is installed and is functioning. Screenshots have
  been taken on Ubuntu 8.10 Intrepid machine running Gnome desktop.
</p>

<p>
To start Firewall Builder use main menu Systsm/Administration
</p>          

<img src="http://www.fwbuilder.org/slideshows/brief_introduction/pict_010.png" alt="" />

<p>
  When program starts, it presents "welcome" dialog that lists urls to
  all sorts of helpful information you can find on the project web
  site. This includes FIrewall Builder Cookbook, FAQ, "getting
  started" tutorial and other documents.
</p>          

<img src="http://www.fwbuilder.org/slideshows/brief_introduction/pict_020.png" alt="" />

<p>
  To create firewall object using main menu "Object/New object" or
  button in the toolbar.
</p>          
<img src="http://www.fwbuilder.org/slideshows/brief_introduction/pict_030.png" alt="" />

<p>
  The program presents the first page of the firewall creation
  "wizard" dialog where you can assign it a name and choose firewall
  platform and host OS. Here the name will be "guardian", platform
  "iptables" and host OS "Linux 2.4/2.6". We will create new firewall
  using one of the preconfigured template objects. Once these choices
  are done, click "Next" at the bottom of the dialog.
</p>          
<img src="http://www.fwbuilder.org/slideshows/brief_introduction/pict_040.png" alt="" />


<p>
  Here the program presents the list of available template
  objects. Since the goal is to create policy to protect desktop
  workstation, we'll choose "Host firewall template 1". The comment at
  the bottom of the dialog explains the purpose of the template and
  what security policy rules are included. After you select the
  template, click "Finish" and the bottom of the dialog to create
  firewall object.
</p>          
<img src="http://www.fwbuilder.org/slideshows/brief_introduction/pict_050.png" alt="" />


<p>
  At this point we already have fully configured firewall object that
  has two interfaces (eth0 and loopback), ethernet interface eth0 is
  supposed to obtain IP address dynamically via DHCP. The object also
  comes with basic firewall policy that blocks all access to the
  machine except for ssh and permits all kinds of connections
  initiated from the machine.
</p>

<p>
  The rules of this preconfigured template firewall object are rather
  simple, however they can be easily extended or modified. The
  template used in this demonstration is probably the smallest and
  simplest of all template objects that come with the package. Other
  templates can be used to create firewalls with two or three
  interfaces, with or without DMZ, with static or dynamic
  interfaces. There are also templates for Cisco router and a basic
  web server in the collection.
</p>

<p>
  We need to configure a couple of parameters before we can activate
  the policy. Click on "Firewall Settings..." button to open firewall
  settings dialog.
</p>          
<img src="http://www.fwbuilder.org/slideshows/brief_introduction/pict_060.png" alt="" />


<p>
  Choose tab "Installer" in the dialog that comes up and enter
  directory where firewall script should be installed, the name of the
  account used to manage the firewall and ip address 127.0.0.1 in the
  field for the address used to communicate with the firewall. We use
  root account to install and activate policy. Make sure that root
  login via ssh is permitted by your sshd configuration. We use
  loopback address because the program will manage policy of the same
  machine it is running on. Once done, click "OK" to save parameters.
</p>

<p>
  Document <a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/guides/firewall_builder_policy_installer.html">Using
Built-in Policy Installer in Firewall Builder</a> explains how to use
regular user account with sudo rather than root to install and
activate policy.
</p>          
<img src="http://www.fwbuilder.org/slideshows/brief_introduction/pict_070.png" alt="" />


<p>
  Now we can compile and install policy. Click right mouse button on
  the firewall object "guardian" in the tree and use menu item
  "Install" in the pop-up menu.
</p>          
<img src="http://www.fwbuilder.org/slideshows/brief_introduction/pict_080.png" alt=""/>


<p>
  The program will want to save the data to a file before it can
  proceed. Here I am choosing existing test file "test2.fwb".
</p>          
<img src="http://www.fwbuilder.org/slideshows/brief_introduction/pict_090.png" alt="" />


<p>
  Once data is saved, the program runs policy compiler and shows its
  progress in the progress log panel of the dialog. Once compiler
  finishes, click "Next" at the bottom of the dialog.
</p>          
<img src="http://www.fwbuilder.org/slideshows/brief_introduction/pict_100.png" alt="" />


<p>
  The program can use either password or ssh key pair to authenticate
  when it logs in to the firewall to install and activate new
  policy. If you use password, enter it in this dialog. However it is
  recommended to use ssh key pair to authenticate rather than root
  password. If your keys are configured, the program will use
  them. Next screenshots demonstrate how it looks like when
  authentication is done via ssh keys. Since we will use keys, leave
  "password" input field blank in this dialog.
</p>          
<img src="http://www.fwbuilder.org/slideshows/brief_introduction/pict_110.png" alt="" />


<p>
  The program tries to log in to the local host as root using ssh. Ssh
  ssh client brings this dialog up and asks you to enter private key
  passphrase. Note that this dialog is not part of Firewall Builder,
  it is part of ssh client.
</p>          
<img src="http://www.fwbuilder.org/slideshows/brief_introduction/pict_130.png" alt="" />


<p>
  Once authentication is done, the program copies generated script to
  the firewall and activates it there. The progress of the installer
  can be seen in the right hand side panel of the dialog.
</p>

<p>
  At this point our new firewall policy is installed and
  activated. See <a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/guides/firewall_builder_howtos.html#000071">this
  HOWTO document</a> that demonstrates how to make the computer
  activate new policy after reboot.
