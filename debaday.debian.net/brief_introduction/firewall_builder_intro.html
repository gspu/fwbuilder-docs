<h1>Firewall Builder: Manage Firewalls Professionally </h1>

<p>
  <a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org">Firewall Builder</a> is available
  from the <b>libfwbuilder</b> and <b>fwbuilder</b> packages in both
  Debian and Ubuntu in Universe. Packages for the current development
  builds are available from the project download area on
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5314&package_id=125359">SourceForge</a>
</p>

<p>
  Eveyone knows about netfilter/iptables, a powerful firewall
  framework and command line tool that is part of every Linux
  distribution. Unfortunately, managing security policy with it
  remains non-trivial task for several of reasons. Partially this is
  because of the complex syntax of the command line interface and
  multitude of the available options and parameters. Another reason is
  that administrator has to understand internal path of the packet
  inside Linux kernel and its interaction with different parts of
  netfilter in order to build rules correctly. This is not a problem
  specific to iptables though, other popular Open Source firewall
  platforms, such as OpenBSD PF, ipfilter and ipfw present similar
  challenges.
</p>

<p>
  What is needed is a tool that could let administrator define
  security policy on a higher level of abstraction and hide internal
  structure of the target firewall platform. For example, such tool
  should decide which iptables chain is right for each generated
  iptables rule automatically, without administrator's input. It
  should also pick the right iptables targets for both policy and NAT
  (Network Address Translation) rules as well as properly use most
  popular iptables modules, all automatically. Such tool should also
  implement best practices in policy design and help administrator
  deploy and activate generated policy on the firewall.
</p>

<p>
  Firewall Builder does just that.

<p>
  Firewall Builder is a GUI firewall configuration and management tool
  that supports <em>iptables (netfilter), ipfilter, pf, ipfw, Cisco
  PIX (FWSM, ASA) and Cisco routers extended access lists</em>. It
  presents all supported firewalls to the administrator in terms of
  unified abstract firewall that takes the best features from all of
  them and hides their specifics and inconveniences. Firewall Builder
  is more complex than many basic firewall configuration GUIs such as
  Firestarter, but on the other hand one can build very complex
  policies with Firewall Builder and fully utilize flexibility and
  power of iptables and other supported firewalls.
</p>

<p>
  General idea should be familiar to anyone who ever worked with
  commercial firewall management systems. All configuration management
  operations can be performed from one central place, Firewall Builder
  GUI. You create and manage collection of objects that describe
  network addresses, hosts and firewalls, as well as services and then
  build firewall policy and NAT rules using these objects. Policy
  rules are defined in terms of "Source" and "Destination" addresses
  and "Service" and can have additional parameters such as interface
  association, direction, time interval and optional
  platform-dependent attributes. NAT rules are defined by addresses
  and services before and after translation. 
</p>

<p>
  Rules are built with simple drag and drop operations and then
  firewall configuration can be generated with one click of a
  mouse. In the end, Firewall Builder produces a script or
  configuration file in the language of the target firewall. For
  iptables, it creates shell script that loads iptables rules, while
  for other platforms it creates configuration file suitable for
  them. This makes it simple to deploy and activate generated policy
  and also helps integrate Firewall Builder with existing automation
  scripts.
</p>

<p>
  Firewall Builder implements many best practices in firewall policy
  design and firewall management procedures. Here just a few examples:
</p>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>It enforces policy structure that denies all traffic by
      default and only permits what is necessary.</li>

    <li>Administrator can easily define ip address of the management
      workstation and Firewall Builder will automatically add rule to
      ensure that ssh access from it to the firewall is always
      permitted. This rule is designed to assure that ssh session over
      which installer activates new policy does not break or
      hang. This helps avoid accidents when errors in the policy rules
      cut remote access to the firewall off in the middle of
      activation, making it impossible to fix the error and causing
      prolonged network outage.</li>

    <li>For Cisco PIX (ASA) and IOS access lists, where each
      access-list commands are immediately activated as they are
      entered, Firewall Builder can optionally create temporary access
      list to ensure uninterrupted ssh access from the management
      workstation to the firewall for the duration of the policy
      reload session. This method provides the best protection against
      outages caused by loss of contact with the firewall because of
      errors in policy.</li>

    <li>For iptables, Firewall Builder can generate script using
      iptables-restore for atomic activation. If iptables-resore
      detects an error in the script and refuses to load policy,
      script leaves the firewall in the state it was in before. For
      other firewall platforms it uses appropriate activation methods
      to achieve the same goal.</li>

    <li>Built-in policy installer supports "test" install mode with
      automatic roll-back. This is another safety mechanism that helps
      minimize outages in case of errors in the policy. These mearures
      are available for all supported systems, such as linux/iptables,
      *BSD/pf, Cisco PIX and Cisco IOS.</li>
  </ul>
