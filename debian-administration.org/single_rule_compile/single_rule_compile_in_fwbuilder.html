<h1>Compiling Single Rule in Firewall Builder 4.0</h1>

<p>
  Article <a href="http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/632">Getting
  Started With Firewall Builder</a> here on Debian Administration site
  attracted many comments.
  <a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/4.0">Firewall Builder 4.0</a>
  addresses some concerns and suggestions expressed there.
</p>

<p>
  One thing comments posted with the article <a class="ulink"
  href="http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/632">Getting
  Started With Firewall Builder</a> show quite clearly, is that
  administrators do not like GUI (or any other kind of high level)
  tools that aren't transparent. It is true that most GUI tools hide
  actual actions they perform because authors believed the tool should
  be trusted completely and therefore it is not necessary to keep
  administrator "in the loop". Applying this to firewall
  administration, this means that the firewall configuration GUI does
  not let the administrator check generated configuration easily,
  assuming that they should trust the tool. Experienced system
  administrators who are experts in iptables or other firewall
  platform understandably do not like that. The program should "earn
  their trust" first, and for that, administrator must have easy
  access to the generated configuration at all times, as simply as
  possible, in order to be able to verify and check the result. This
  leads to the conclusion that such GUI tool is only good for the
  beginners because they do not understand underlying technology
  anyway and so can only get any work done if they use such tool.
</p>

<p>
  As an author of <a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/4.0">Firewall
  Builder</a> and systems and network administrator with over 10 years
  of experience, I believe the GUI tool such as Firewall Builder can
  be very useful for both categories of users: the beginners and
  experienced administrators as well. Firewall Builder, when properly
  used, reduces repetitive tasks, helps perform coordinated policy
  changes for multiple firewalls and routers, provides early error
  checking and simplifies deployment. In the end, it saves time in
  regular day-to-day maintenance and helps reduce potential downtime
  caused by errors.  There is value in that, even for someone who can
  write or maintain complex iptables scripts by hand. Still, to make
  experienced administrators more comfortable, the program should make
  it easy to quickly check what iptables (or other) commands are being
  generated.
</p>

<p>
 With this in mind, Firewall Builder 4.0 adds new feature that does
 just that.
</p>

<p>
  While you're developing your firewall policy, you can now compile
  individual rules to confirm that they do what you intended. To do
  this, right-click anywhere in the rule to open context menu, then
  select menu item "Compile". Or, highlight the rule and use keyboard
  shortcut "x". This is a great way to experiment with fwbuilder and
  see what it generates for different rule configurations built in the
  GUI. This feature works for all supported firewall platforms and all
  types of rules (Policy, NAT and routing).
