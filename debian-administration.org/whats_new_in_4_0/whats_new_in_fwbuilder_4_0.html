  Firewall Builder 4.0 is a major upgrade, it adds many
  improvements across all components of the program. To name a
  few, it adds support for the high availability firewall
  configurations; improves the way generated script manages IP
  addresses and adds ability to manage VLAN, bridge and bonding
  interfaces; the GUI now has undo/redo facility of unlimited
  depth and can compile a single rule and immediately show the
  result. There are many other improvements and changes, all
  listed in
  the <a class="ulink" href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/4.0/docs/firewall_builder_release_notes.html">Firewall
    Builder 4.0 Release Notes</a>.
</p>

<p>

  If you are not familiar with Firewall Builder, you can find many
  introductory articles on the Internet and our own project web
  site. Articles <a class="ulink"
  href="http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/632">Getting
  Started With Firewall Builder</a> on this stie and <a class="ulink"
  href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/docs/firewall_builder_intro.html">Introduction
  to Firewall Builder</a> on the project web site give good overview.
</p>

<p>
  In this article I am going to explore most interesting and
  significant new features of the new version. You can find more
  information on each feature and detailed HOWTO guides in the
  <a class="ulink" href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/4.0/docs/users_guide/">Firewall

<p>
  One thing comments posted with the article <a class="ulink"
  href="http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/632">Getting
  Started With Firewall Builder</a> here on Debian Administration site
  show quite clearly, is that administrators do not like GUI (or any
  other kind of high level) tools that aren't transparent. It is true
  that some GUI tools hide actual actions they perform because authors
  believed that the tool should be trusted completely and therefore it
  is not necessary to have administrator "in the loop" at
  all. Applying this to firewall administration, this means that the
  firewall configuration GUI does not let the administrator check
  generated configuration easily, assuming that they should trust the
  tool. Experienced system administrators who are experts in iptables
  or other firewall platform understandably do not like that. The tool
  should "earn their trust" first, and for that administrator must
  have easy access to the generated configuration at all times, as
  simply as possible, in order to be able to verify and check the
  tool.
</p>


<p>
  As an author of Firewall Builder and systems and network
  administrator with over 10 years of experience, I believe the GUI
  tool such as Firewall Builder can be very useful for experienced
  administrators. Firewall Builder, when properly used, reduces
  repetitive tasks, helps perform coordinated policy changes in
  configuration for multiple firewalls and routers, provides early
  error checking and simplifies deployment. In the end, it saves time
  in regular day-to-day maintenance and helps reduce potential
  downtime caused by errors.  There is value in that, even for someone
  who can write or maintain complex iptables scripts by hand. Still,
  to make experienced administrators more comfortable, the program
  should make it easy to quickly check what iptables (or other)
  commands are being generated.
</p>

<p>
 With this in mind, Firewall Builder 4.0 adds new feature that does
 just that.
</p>

<p>
  While you're developing your firewall policy, you can now compile
  individual rules to confirm that they do what you intended. To do
  this, right-click anywhere in the rule to open context menu, then
  select menu item "Compile". Or, highlight the rule and use keyboard
  shortcut "x". This is a great way to experiment with fwbuilder and
  see what it generates for different rule configurations built in the
  GUI. This feature works for all supported firewall platforms and all
  types of rules (Policy, NAT and routing).

<p>
        The GUI was redesigned to help reduce unnecessary clicks and
        streamline the workflow, especially for situations with many
        objects in the object tree. The editor panel and object tree
        are now detachable. You can "float" these windows and
        rearrange them on the screen any way you want. If you work
        with several data files opened simulteneously, each of them
        appears its own project window with object tree and rules but
        they all share the same editor panel.
      </p>
<div class="figure">
<a name="floating_object_tree"></a><p class="title"><b>Figure 2. Floating object tree panel</b></p>
<div class="figure-contents"><div><img src="http://www.fwbuilder.org/4.0/docs/whats_new/floating-object-tree1.png" alt="Floating object tree panel"></div></div>
</div>
<br class="figure-break"><p>
        Object editor panel can also float, making it easier to keep
        the tree, rule set panel and editor open on a machine with
        small screen such is a laptop, and still have enough rules
        visible at once. You can also change the font used to show
        objects in the tree and in rules.
      </p>
<p>
        A new "Filter" input field has been added above the object
        tree. Typing fragment of the name in this field automatically
        limits set of objects shown in the tree to those that match
        what was typed. The filter maintain history of strings entered
        in it for the duration of the session.
      </p>

</div>
<br class="figure-break"><p>
        The GUI can show brief summary of object attributes in the
        second column in the object tree. This is controlled by a
        checkbox in the global preferences dialog, tab "Objects" and
        is off by default. The first column always shows object icon
        and its name, the second (optional) column shows its
        attributes.

</div>
<br class="figure-break"><p>
        Another convenient shortcut is a new button called "Add object
        to a groups directly from the group dialog" that appears in
        the group object dialog. When you click this button, a menu
        appears that allows you to create new object and add it to the
        group in one operation. This is shown in the screenshot below:
      </p>

</div>
<br class="figure-break"><p>
        The GUI now has unlimited <span class="emphasis"><em>Undo/Redo
        facility</em></span> accessible via standard keyboard shortcuts
        Ctrl-Z and Ctrl-Y (Cmd-Z and Cmd-Y on Mac OS X). You monitor
        undo stack using special panel that you can open using
        menu <span class="emphasis"><em>"View/Undo stack"</em></span>. Clicking on the
        entries in undo stack rolls operations back or forward.
      </p>
<p>
        One of the most annoying features of the old version was the
        neccesity to click "Apply" after each change made to an
        object.  This amounted to significant number of clicks when
        you had to cerate and edit many objects. Firewall Builder 4.0
        did away with this button, all changes made in an object
        dialog are saved into the object immediately. This does not
        change the data in the .fwb file, only objects in
        memory. Combined with Undo, this allows for faster object
        editing and roll back of changes.
      </p>
<p>
        Error and warning messages generated by the policy compilers
        are highlighted in the compiler output panel when you compile
        single rule. When you compile all rules of the firewall using
        toolbar buttons or main menu items "Compile" or "Install",
        errors and warnings are also highlighted in the
        dialog. Clicking on the error or warning message opens
        corresponding firewall and selects the rule that caused it.
      </p>
<p>
        Firewall Builder has a great way to help you create new
        firewall object from scratch faster, that is a collection of
        template objects. These objects come preconfigured with
        interfaces, ip addresses and basic rules. Unfortunately, most
        likely these ip addresses do not match addresses you use in
        your network, which means in the past you had change addresses
        of interfaces after the new firewall object has been created.
        This is not too difficult, but it wasn't enough. You had to
        use search and replace function to change addresses of all
        objects used in the rules as well. This was more tedious and
        potentially error-prone.
      </p>
<p>
        Now you can change ip addresses of interfaces of the new
        firewall while it is being created in the wizard dialog. When
        you create new firewall object from a template, the "new
        firewall" wizard includes interface editor page where you can
        change addresses as well as interface names and types (static
        or dynamic). The program not only changes addresses of
        interfaces, it also scans policy and NAT rules of the template
        looking for network objects that match original template
        addresses and replaces them with network objects that match
        new ones.
      </p>

<div class="sect1" title="Password caching in built-in installer">
<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
<a name="id36114508"></a>Password caching in built-in installer</h2></div></div></div>
<p>
        Built-in policy installer uses ssh to communicated with the
        firewall and needs user name and password for authentication.
        Firewall Builder does not store passwords permanently, which
        means you have to enter the password every time you want to
        update configuration of the firewall. Ssh agent certainly
        helps alleviate this problem, but if you do not use the agent,
        you still have to type the password again and again. Some
        devices do not even support ssh agent authentication, these
        are Cisco routers and ASA firewalls.
      </p>
<p>
        Firewall Builder 4.0 introduces password caching that can help
        in this situation. Built-in installer can remember firewall
        password (and enable password for Cisco) for the duration of
        the session. Passwords are never stored permanently in any
        form, encrypted or plain text, they are only kept in memory of
        working Firewall Builder GUI instance. You need to enter
        password once when you activate generated policy for the firs
        time. If you keep the program open and need to modify and
        activate policy again, the password fields in the installer
        dialog can be filled automatically. The feature is optional
        and is off by default.
      </p>
<p>
        <span class="emphasis"><em>Warning</em></span>: using this feature creates
        certain risk if working Firewall Builder GUI is left
        unattended on unlocked workstation. Someone may walk up to the
        machine and make changes to the firewall using cached password
        of the administrator who used the same GUI session
        before. Always lock the screen or exit Firewall Builder GUI
        when leaving computer.

<div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both">
<a name="id36114542"></a>Customazable templates ("configlets")</h2></div></div></div>

<p>
        Configlets: generated firewall script (for all platforms) is
        assembled from small fragments we call "configlets". These
        fragments are located in the
        "/usr/share/fwbuilder-4.0.0/configlets" (on Linux). Each
        configlet is a template that uses specially defined macros
        which the program replaces with actual strings and values when
        it generates firewall configuration. There are separate
        templates for different firewall platforms and for different
        parts of the configuration file to be created. Supported macro
        language includes simple variable expansion and conditional
        "If - then" construct. You can override configlets we provide
        with your own if you create directory "fwbuilder/configlets"
        in your home directory and place files with the same name
        there. You need to retain the structure of subdirectories
        inside this directory, that is, the directory should be
        "$HOME/fwbuilder/configlets/linux24" for the configlets
        installed in "linux24" subdirectory under
        "/usr/share/fwbuilder/configlets". This way, you can change
        virtually all aspects of generated configuration file to suite
        your needs without having to touch C++ code and recompile the
        whole project.
      </p>
<p>
        Built-in policy installer also gets commands that it needs to
        execute on the firewall from configlets. Two configlets are
        used for Unix-based firewalls (Linux, OpenWRT, Sveasoft, IPCOP
        and its variants, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, MacOSX, Solaris):
        "installer_commands_reg_user" and
        "installer_commands_root". You can change the behavior of the
        installer without having to touch C++ code, just create a copy
        of the configlet file in $HOME/fwbuilder/configlets and modify
        it.
      </p>
<p>
        This is the first time we introduced configlets to Firewall
        Builder. At this time, the macro language is rather primitive
        and will improve in the future, for example we need to add
        support for the if-then-else construct and interations. Most
        configlets document variables they use (and fwbuilder knows
        about) at the top of the configlet file.
</p>

  chapter <a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/4.0/docs/users_guide/configlets.html">"Configlets"</a>

<p>
        Generated iptables script now has standard structure per LSB
        ("Linux Standard Base Core Specification 3.1"). The script
        supports standard actions controlled by the command line
        arguments <span class="command"><strong>"start"</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>"stop"</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>"reload"</strong></span>, <span class="command"><strong>"status"</strong></span>. Action
        <span class="command"><strong>"start"</strong></span> reconfigures interfaces, flushes
        current iptables tables and chains and finally loads new
        iptables configuration. Action <span class="command"><strong>"stop"</strong></span>
        flushes all tables and chains and sets default policy in all
        chains to "DROP" to shut down the firewall to all kinds of
        traffic. Note that the "backup ssh access" rule that was
        available in the previous versions of fwbuilder now has an
        option that can make the script install this rule even when it
        drops all other iptables rules when called with command
        "stop". This means, you can call the script with command
        "stop" to completely shut down all traffic to and through the
        firewall, but still retain access to the firewall via ssh.
        Action <span class="command"><strong>"status"</strong></span> finishes with return code
        per LSB specification. Code 0 means the firewall is loaded and
        is running (but it does not check that the rules it is running
        with are those defined in fwbuilder). Return code 3 means
        iptables modules are not loaded or there are no tables. This
        return code means the firewall is not running or not
        configured. The script also supports additional actions
        <span class="command"><strong>"interfaces"</strong></span>
        and <span class="command"><strong>"test_interfaces"</strong></span>. Action
        <span class="command"><strong>"interfaces"</strong></span> executes only commands that
        manage ip addresses of interfaces, configure vlan, bridge and
        bonding
        interfaces. Action <span class="command"><strong>"test_interfaces"</strong></span> runs
        the same commands in the test mode when it prints commands
        that would be executed but does not actually execute them.

<p>
        The most significant improvement in Firewall Builder 4.0 is of
        course introduction of support for the firewall clusters. The
        code for this feature was originally contributed to the
        project by the developers from Secunet Security Networks AG,
        Germany. Their original add-on supported SecunetWall
        firewalls, we have extended it, improved the GUI and added
        support for OpenBSD (CARP) and PIX clusters as well.
      </p>
<p>
        In a typical High Availability (HA) configuration the firewall
        or a server is replaced with two or more machines running
        special software that alows them to monitor status of each
        other. These machines share common resources, such as IP
        addresses, and when one of the machines fails, others take
        over resources it used. Firewall Builder generates firewall
        configuration for each member of the cluster.
      </p>
<p>
        The idea is to manage configuration for multiple member
        firewalls using single object that we call "Cluster" in
        Firewall Builder GUI. The program then makes sure generated
        configuration for each member firewall includes necessary
        rules to permit packets generated by the HA software. You can
        build policy and NAT rules just using object that represent
        the cluster and the program will use IP shared addresses that
        belong to the cluster and addresses that belong to each
        individual machine. This saves time and helps avoid errors
        because you do not need to replicate configuration changes
        manually in the rules of each member firewall.
      </p>
<p>
        Firewall Builder can generate firewall rules that support both
        failover and state synchronization protocols for clusters
        build with iptables, PF or PIX and in some cases cluster
        configuration itself as well. The following state
        synchronization and failover protocols are supported at this
        time:

<br class="reg_table-break"><p>
        Firewall Builder automatically generates policy rules to permit
        packets of these protocols when it sees firewall cluster
        configured with one of them. You can use cluster object and its
        interfaces instead of the member firewall objects or their
        interfaces in policy and NAT rules and the program will
        substitute correct addresses when it generates iptables script
        or PF or PIX configuration.
      </p>
<p>
        The new object "Cluster" represents an HA pair of
        firewalls. To establish correspondence between interfaces of
        the pair, we add Interface objects to the Cluster. Cluster
        interface object is an abstraction that serves two purposes:
        it ties together corresponding interfaces of the member
        firewalls and also it provides the place to store
        configuration of the failover protocol that runs on these
        interfaces of the members. Each cluster interface object has
        child object "Failover group" with the name
        "firewall:eth0:members" or similar. This is where you
        configure associated member firewall
        interfaces. <a class="xref" href="#linux_cluster_interface_mappings" title="Figure 8. Failover group objects and mapping between cluster and member interfaces">Figure 8</a>
        illustrates this. Blue arrows show that failover group object
        "linux-cluster:eth0:members" holds pointers to interfaces
        "eth0" of member firewalls "linux-test-1" and
        "linux-test-2". Interface object "eth0" that belongs to the
        cluster "linux-cluster" represents interfaces "eth0" of these
        member firewalls in all policy and NAT rules.  IP address
        objects that belong to the cluster interface represent shared
        IP addresses managed by the cluster software. In Linux
        cluster, these are the addresses managed by vrrpd or heartbeat
        daemons.  In OpenBSD cluster, these addresses belong to the
        "carp0" interface. Cluster interface object can have more than
        one address, just like the cluster software can manage several
        addresses.
      </p>
<p>
        Now if you need to build a policy rule for the cluster that
        should match eth0, you can just use cluster interface object
        "eth0" in the rule and the program will use IP address of eth0
        of the member firewall when it compiles rules for that member.
      </p>
<p>
        Failover group object also has an attribute that defines the
        type of the failover protocol used on these interfaces of
        the member firewalls and a set of parameters for this
        protocol, such as VHID for CARP, an address and port for
        heartbeat and so on. Since failover protocol configuration
        is stored separately with each cluster interface object, it
        is easy to configure clusters running different protocols on
        different interfaces or running failover protocol only on
        some interfaces.
      </p>
<p>
        Another new type of object that is used to build cluster
        configuration is "State Sync Group" object. This object is a
        child of a Cluster and is located immediately under it in the
        object tree (<a class="xref" href="#linux_cluster_statesync_mappings" title="Figure 9. State synchronization group object">Figure 9</a>).
      </p>
<p>
        State synchronization group object is used to store
        information about interface of the member firewalls used to
        run state synchronization protocol and parameters of this
        protocol. At this time Firewall Builder supports conntrackd
        protocol for Linux, pfsync for OpenBSD and PIX synchronization
        protocol for Cisco ASA (PIX) appliances. Firewall Builder
        automatically generates policy rules to permit packets of the
        protocol and in some cases configuration of the protocol
        software.
      </p>
<p>
        Firewall Builder provides convenient wizard-like dialog that
        helps create new cluster object from existing individual
        firewall objects. You start with the list of firewall objects
        where you choose which firewalls should become members of the
        cluster. Next, the program finds interfaces of the member
        firewalls that have the same name and can be part of the
        cluster and creates cluster interfaces with the same name
        (<a class="xref" href="#new_cluster_wizard_page" title="Figure 6. New cluster wizard">Figure 6</a>). Not all
        interfaces are eligible, for example bridge ports, bonding
        interface slaves or parents of vlan interfaces can not be used
        for the cluster. You can add, remove or rename cluster
        interfaces, as well as change which interfaces of the member
        firewalls are used with each one. On the next page of the
        wizard you can change failover protocols and add, remove or
        change IP addresses of cluster interfaces. Finally, you can
        choose to use policy and NAT rules of one of the member
        firewalls to populate Policy and NAT rule sets of the new
        cluster. If this is done, all references to the original
        member firewall and its interfaces in rules are replaced with
        references to the cluster and its interfaces. The program also
        creates backup copies of the member firewall objects with the
        name with suffix "-bak" and clears Policy and NAT rule sets of
        the member firewall objects used with the cluster before new
        cluster is created.

        To generate script or configuration files for both member
        firewalls, you need to compile cluster object just like you
        normally compile standalone firewall. Use toolbar buttons or
        context menu to do this. The program will compile cluster
        Policy, NAT and Routing rule sets twice, for each member
        firewall. As the result, it produces two scripts or
        configuration files, one for each member. Built-in policy
        installer then can install these geenrated files on the member
        firewalls.

          All failover protocols available on Linux do not create

          heartbeat, vrrp, OpenAIS. To build Linux cluster

          using the same name as corresponding member firewall
          interfaces as shown in

          OpenBSD cluster built with CARP failover protocol and pfsync
          state synchronization protocol looks little different. CARP
          uses its own special interface "carp0" as a configuration
          and management mechanism on OpenBSD. In Firewall Builder,
          this is reflected in the name of the cluster interface
          object which becomes "carp0" or "carp1". State
          synchronization protocol, likewise, uses interface
          "pfsync0".  Activation script created by Firewall Builder
          for the PF cluster includes commands that set up both carp
          and pfsync interfaces and assign parameters. Interface
          mapping between OpenBSD cluster object and corresponding
          member firewall objects is shown in
          <a class="xref" href="#openbsd_cluster_interface_mappings" title="Figure 10. OpenBSD cluster: failover and state synchronization group objects and mapping between cluster and member interfaces">Figure 10</a>. To
          configure this mapping, open Failover Group or State
          Synchronization group object in the editor by double
          clicking it in the tree.

<p>
          Firewall Builder supports PIX "LAN based" failover
          configuration. Unlike in Linux or BSD, where each interface
          of the firewall runs its own instance of failover protocol,
          PIX runs one instance of failover protocol over dedicated
          interface. PIX can also run state synchronization protocol
          over the same or another dedicated interface. These
          dedicated interfaces should be connected via separate switch
          and do not see regular traffic. Here is how this is
          implemented in Firewall Builder.
        </p>
<p>
          Like with all other supported firewall platforms, interface
          objects that belong to a cluster object serve to establish
          association between actual interfaces of the member
          firewalls. Cluster interface object should have the same
          name as corresponding member firewall interfaces. It should
          have Failover Group child object which should be configured
          with interfaces of the member firewalls. Here is an example
          of interface mapping between cluster and member firewalls:
        </p>
<p>
          </p>
<div class="figure">

</div>
<p><br class="figure-break">
        </p>
<p>
          PIX does not use special shared IP addresses for the
          cluster, therefore cluster interface objects in Firewall
          Builder do not have IP addresses. Interface "Ethernet2" in
          the screenshot above is used for the dedicated failover
          connection; the object that represents it in each member
          firewall should be marked as "Dedicated failover
          interface". This is new attribute of the Interface object
          added in Firewall Buidler 4.0.
        </p>
<p>
          Cluster object should have State Synchronization group child
          object. In this object you need to configure member
          interfaces that should be used for state
          synchronization. You can use separate dedicated interfaces
          or the same interfaces used for failover. If these are
          separate, corresponding interface objects of the member
          firewalls must be marked as "Dedicated Failover".
        </p>
<p>
          One of the member firewall interfaces used in the State
          Synchronization group must be marked as "master". This is
          where you define which PIX unit is going to be the primary
          and which is going to be the secondary in the HA pair.
        </p>
<p>
          Here is an example of the state synchronization and failover
          using the same interface Ethernet2:

<p>
          Normally, only the cluster object should have non-empty
          policy, NAT and routing rule sets, while member firewall
          objects should have empty rule sets. In this case, Firewall
          Builder policy compilers will use rules they find in the
          cluster. However, if a member firewall has rule set object
          of any type (Policy, NAT, Routing) with the name the same as
          the name of the cluster object and the same type, then
          compilers will use rules from the member firewall and ignore
          those found in the cluster. They also issue a warning that
          looks like shown in
          <a class="xref" href="#cluster_rule_set_override_warning" title="Figure 13. A warning shown when a rule set that belongs to the member firewall overrides rule set that belongs to the cluster">Figure 13</a>:

</div>
<br class="figure-break"><p>
          Suggested use case for this feature is to create a small
          non-top rule set in the cluster which can be used as a
          branch using a rule with action "Branch" to pass control to
          it. The cluster can define some rules in this rule set,
          these rules are going to be common for all member
          firewalls. However if for some reason you want to implement
          these rules differently for one member, you just create rule
          set with the same name in it and add some different rules
          there. Of course two members can have the rule set with this
          name and both will override the one that belongs to the
          cluster. The warning is only given if member firewall rule
          set is not empty. If it exists and has the same name as the
          one that belongs to the cluster, but has no rules, then the
          warning does not appear.

        The NAT rule set now has additional column "Action" with just
        two actions: "Translate" and "Branch". Action "Branch" passes
        control to another NAT rule set. This has been implemented for
        iptables and PF. For iptables, compiler generates command
        using "-j target" clause in the "nat" table. For PF, it
        generates "anchor" or "nat-anchor" (depending on the version
        of PF).

        Generated activation script compares IP addresses of
        interfaces on the firewall machine with those configured in
        Firewall Builder objects and adds or removes them as
        appropriate to bring two in sync. If lists of interfaces
        match, the script does nothing. Activation script generated by
        previous versions of Firewall Builder removed all addresses,
        then added them back to make sure address configuration of the
        machine matches fwbuilder objects. New version does not do
        that, which makes policy activation a lot safer. 
      </p>
<p>
        The program supports new types of interfaces: VLAN, bridge,
        bonding. This is fully implemented for Linux and partially for
        other platforms. VLANs are added as child objects of an
        interface, like so:

<p>
        The program can generate commands to configure vlans, bridges
        and bonding interfaces on Linux. This is off by default and
        controlled by checkboxes in the "script" tab of the firewall
        object dialog. Generated script adds and removes vlans,
        bridges, bridge ports, bond and bond slaves
        incrementally. That is, the script analyzes existing vlan
        interfaces and compares them with vlan interfaces defined in
        the Firewall Builder GUI and then adds new ones and removes
        those that do not exist in fwbuilder. The same algorithm is
        used to create bridges, add or remove bridge ports and create
        bonds and then add or remove slave interfaces.

<p>
        Built-in installer can use scp to copy generated IOS or PIX
        configuration to the device. This means it works much much
        faster then before. I would like to show some comparison
        figures to demonstrate just how much faster it is, but the
        comparison is really meaningles. Entering router or firewall
        configuration line by line, as in the old fwbuilder, is very
        slow, especially over high latency network connection. Copying
        the whole script using scp happens in a few seconds.
      </p>
<p>
        While updating configuration of a router or a firewall,
        fwbuilder copies generated configuration
        using <span class="command"><strong>"scp"</strong></span> command to the router and then
        executes it using <span class="command"><strong>"copy file
        running-config"</strong></span> command. It does not
        use <span class="command"><strong>"config replace"</strong></span> command because
        configuration created by fwbuilder is incomplete and should be
        merged with running config rather than replace it.
      </p>
<p>
        For this to work, of course, scp support must be enabled on
        the router or firewall for this to work. There should also be
        enough room on the flash storage on the device. Not all
        versions of IOS and PIX support scp, you are going to have to
        check the version you are running.

<a name="id36115616"></a>Using EEM for automatic rollback of the configuration changes with Cisco routers</h2></div></div></div>
<p>
        Built-in policy installer uses EEM (Embedded Event Manager) on
        IOS 12.4 or later to schedule automatic configuration rollback
        instead of reloading the router. EEM appears in IOS 12.4 and
        supports background operations that can be triggered by some
        events on the router or by the timer. In this new feature,
        fwbuilder creates EEM applet with a countdown timer that
        executes command <span class="command"><strong>"config replace nvram:startup-config
        force"</strong></span> when timer expires. User has the following
        options, controlled by checkboxes in the fwbuilder installer
        parameters dialog:
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p>
            Schedule automatic rollback in a few minutes and install
            updated ACL configuration. This can be used to test new
            policy and revert to the original one after some short
            period of time. This also helps to avoid a situation when
            updated policy blocks access to the router because of an
            error; rolling back to the ACL configuration that was
            running before the update will restore access
            automatically.
          </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
            Schedule rollback in a few minutes, install updated ACL
            but cancel rollback if installation of the new
            configuration was successful. This is mostly intended to
            prevent blocking access to the router in case of an error
            in the new ACL configuration. If fwbuilder was able to
            enter all lines of the new configuration all the way to
            the end, this means new configuration does not block
            access and installer executes command <span class="command"><strong>"no event
            manager applet fwbuilder-rollback"</strong></span> to cancel
            scheduled rollback.
          </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>
        Since IOS before 12.4 does not have EEM, automatic rollback on
        these older versions is implemented by scheduling router
        reload with command <span class="command"><strong>"reload in "</strong></span>. This
        hasn't changed since Firewall Builder v3.0

<a name="id36115683"></a>Automatic generation of "mirrored" rules for Cisco routers</h2></div></div></div>
<p>
        Policy rule option "Add mirrored rule" (controlled by a
        checkbox in the rule options dialog) makes policy compiler for
        IOS ACL automatically create a rule with mirrored source and
        destination addresses and service fields. This can be used to
        match "reply" packets using address and service parameters
        matched by this rule. The action of the mirrored rule is the
        same as that of this one. Firewall Builder recognizes the
        following services and creates "mirrored" versions as follows:
      </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem"><p>
            UDP service: mirrored service has source and destination
            port ranges reversed
          </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
            TCP service: mirrored service has source and destination
            port ranges reversed and "established" flag inverted. If
            TCP service used in this rule does not have "established"
            flag, the mirrored service gets it, and the other way
            around. This is designed to simplify creating ACL rules to
            permit "reply" TCP packets
          </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
            ICMP service: ICMP echo request is recognized, mirrored
            service becomes ICMP echo reply. Other ICMP types are
            simply copied to the mirrored service
          </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
            ICMPv6 service: like with ICMP, ICMP echo request is
            recognized and other ICMPv6 types are just copied
          </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
            IP service: mirrored service is a copy
          </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>
        This feature helps generate router access lists to permit
        specific services in both directions, saving you time in that
        you do not have to remember to add rules for the reply
        packets.
