      <title>Working with multiple data files</title>

      <para>This section shows an example of working with two data
      files at the same time.</para>

  <para>
    We start with a data file. Note the file name, "policy_rules.fwb", is
    shown in the main window title bar.
  </para>

      <para>

    <graphic width="50%" fileref="fwbuilder_gui/images/multifile_slide_1.png"/>
  </figure>
      </para>

  <para>
    Use <guimenuitem>File/Open</guimenuitem> to open another data
    file.
  </para>

      <para>

    <title>Data file</title>
    <graphic width="50%" fileref="fwbuilder_gui/images/multifile_slide_2.png"/>
  </figure>
      </para>

  <para>
    Here we see file "clusters.fwb" opened in the GUI. Its name is now shown
    in the title bar of the window.
  </para>

      <para>
  <figure>
    <title>clusters.fwb</title>
    <graphic width="50%" fileref="fwbuilder_gui/images/multifile_slide_3.png"/>
  </figure>
      </para>

  <para>
    The <guimenu>Window</guimenu> menu supports the usual windows
    operations: you can maximize and minimize them, as well as cascade
    or tile them and switch from one to another.
  </para>

      <para>
  <figure>
    <title>Window menu</title>
    <graphic width="50%" fileref="fwbuilder_gui/images/multifile_slide_4.png"/>
  </figure>
      </para>

  <para>
    Here we have both windows shown. The size of the main windows was
    rather small to keep the size of the screen shots down, so two
    windows do not fit well. However even with such a cramped layout
    we can move objects from one to another using copy/paste operations. In this example we are going to copy-and-paste the 
    firewall object "fw" from the top window to the bottom one. We
    are going to paste it into the folder "Firewalls" in the tree.
  </para>

      <para>
  <figure>
    <title>Copy/pasting between windows</title>
    <graphic width="50%" fileref="fwbuilder_gui/images/multifile_slide_5.png"/>
  </figure>
      </para>

  <para>
    Here we maximized the window showing data file "clusters.fwb"; note that
    firewall object "fw" is part of the tree.
  </para>

      <para>
  <figure>
    <title>Top window now has the object</title>
    <graphic width="50%" fileref="fwbuilder_gui/images/multifile_slide_6.png"/>
  </figure>
      </para>

  <para>
    In addition, firewall "fw" used a host object called "dmz-server" in the data
    file "policy_rules.fwb". Copying the firewall object "fw" also copied
    all other objects it depended on. This image shows that host
    "dmz-server" is now part of the data file "clusters.fwb".
  </para>

      <para>
  <figure>
    <title>dmz-server</title>
    <graphic width="50%" fileref="fwbuilder_gui/images/multifile_slide_7.png"/>
  </figure>
      </para>
