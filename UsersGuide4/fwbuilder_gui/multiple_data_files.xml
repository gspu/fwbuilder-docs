      <title>Working with Multiple Data Files</title>

      <para>This section presents an example of how to work with two data
      files at the same time.</para>

  <para>
    The example begins with one data file. The file name, "policy_rules.fwb", displays in the main window title bar.
  </para>

      </para>

  <para>
    Use <guimenuitem>File > Open</guimenuitem> to open the second data
    file.
  </para>

      </para>

  <para>
    The file "clusters.fwb" is now open in the GUI; its name displays
    in the title bar of the window.
  </para>

      <para>
  <figure>
    <title>clusters.fwb</title>
    <graphic width="50%" fileref="fwbuilder_gui/images/multifile_slide_3.png"/>

      </para>

  <para>
    The <guimenu>Window</guimenu> menu supports standard window
    operations: you can maximize and minimize windows, as well as cascade
    or tile them and switch from one to another.
  </para>

      </para>

  <para>
    Now both windows show. The size of the main windows is small
    to reduce the size of the screen shots; as a result the two windows
    windows do not fit well. Even so, objects can be easily moved between windows
    using copy and paste operations. In this example the 
    firewall object "fw" will be copied from the top window and pasted into "Firewalls" in the tree of the bottom window. 
  </para>

  <para>
     The following figure shows the window with the "clusters.fwb" data file maximized; note that
    firewall object "fw" is part of the tree.

  </figure>
      </para>

  <para>
    The firewall in the example, "fw", used a host object called "dmz-server" in the data
    file "policy_rules.fwb". The system automatically copies "dmz-server" along with the "fw" object, as well as any other 
    obect the "fw" object depends on.
    The following figure shows that host
    "dmz-server" is now part of the "clusters.fwb" data file.
  </para>
