      <para>The object tree stores all objects in a predefined
      hierarchy:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          Types that correspond to network objects (hosts,
          address ranges, networks, and groups of these) are located in
          the <guilabel>Objects</guilabel> branch.</listitem>
        <listitem>Types that correspond to services are located in the <guilabel>Services</guilabel> branch.</listitem>
        <listitem>Time intervals are located in the <guilabel>Time</guilabel> branch.</listitem>
        <listitem>All firewalls are located in the <guilabel>Firewalls</guilabel> branch. </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
       <para>Newly created objects are
      automatically placed in the appropriate position in the
      tree. Each branch of the tree is automatically sorted by the
      object name.</para>

      <para>The program has three default libraries: <guilabel>User</guilabel>, <guilabel>Standard</guilabel>,
        and <guilabel>Deleted Objects</guilabel>. </para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>The <guilabel>User</guilabel> library holds objects
      that you define, including objects for your firewall, hosts, and
      networks.</listitem>
        <listitem>The <guilabel>Standard</guilabel> library holds a collection of
          predefined standard objects that come with Firewall Builder. Note that you need not 
          (and cannot) insert objects into the Standard tree.</listitem> 
      <listitem>The <guilabel>Deleted Objects</guilabel> library acts like a trash can
      or recycle bin for user objects you delete. Note that the Deleted Objects library must be enabled
      using the <guimenuitem>File > Preferences > Objects > Show deleted
      objects</guimenuitem> menu option.</listitem> 
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>In addition, you can
        create custom libraries by selecting <guimenuitem>New
          Library</guimenuitem> from the <guimenu>New Object</guimenu>
        menu. You can populate the new library by copying and pasting objects other views or by creating them from
        scratch within the new library.  <xref linkend="new-library" /> provides instructions for
          creating and distributing user-defined libraries.</para>

      <para>Functionally, there is no difference between having an
      object in the Standard tree, the User tree, or a user-defined
      tree; it is just a convenient way to sort objects in the
      tree. You can think of each as a kind of the "view". The choice of tree affect only
      the display of the data in the GUI; objects are all
      equal in all other senses and you can use an object from any
      library in your policy. </para>

      <para>The object that is currently selected in the tree is
      highlighted in color and is shown in the dialog area on the
      right.</para>

      tree (though not in the read-only Standard tree). If you
      right-click a folder, you can only create objects appropriate to
      that folder. For example, an interface object can only be
      placed under a host or firewall object, so the
      <guimenuitem>Add Interface</guimenuitem> option is available
      only if you right-click a host or firewall.</para>

      <para>Another way to create objects is to use
      the <guimenuitem>Duplicate</guimenuitem> option when you right-click 
        an object. This allows you to create a copy of the
      object. For example, you may want to create a firewall policy
      for one platform, duplicate it, then just change the target
      platform on the copy. Note that copies are not linked in any
      way. A change to the original has no affect on the copy, and
      vice versa.</para>
