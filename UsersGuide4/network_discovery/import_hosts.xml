      <title>Reading the /etc/hosts file</title>

      <para>This method imports the host records present in the standard
      <emphasis>/etc/hosts</emphasis> file or any other file that contain
      records in the following format (this format is actually described in
      the manual page hosts(5)).</para>

      <para>IP_Address host_name</para>

      <para>The IP address must be separated from the host name with any
      number of spaces or tab symbols. Lines starting with '#' are considered
      comments and are ignored.</para>

      <para>When you choose the import from /etc/hosts on the first page, the
      Druid asks you for the file path and name on the next page. Once that
      information is entered, it reads the contents of that file and presents
      a table of new networks (<xref linkend="discovery-hosts-1" />).</para>

      <para>
        Once you have chosen the file, click Next to let the program
        read and parse it. The file should be in "/etc/hosts" format;
        that is it should have an address and host name on each line,
        separated by any number of white spaces. Here is an example:

      <para>
        Once the program finishes importing, you can click Next to move

      <para>
        You can select any number of addresses in the left panel and
        use buttons "--&gt;" and "&lt;--" to add or remove them to the
        panel on the right. The "Select All" and "Unselect All" buttons
        help to work with large lists of addresses.
