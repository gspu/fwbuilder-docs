	<title>Running multiple services on the same machine on
	different virtual addresses and different ports</title>

	  <para> Here is an example of how Firewall Builder can be
	  used to build a firewall protecting a server. Suppose we run
	  several secure web servers on the same machine and use
	  virtual IP addresses to be able to supply different
	  certificates for each one.</para>

	  <para>In addition, we run webmin on the same machine that we
	  use to manage it. We need to permit access on protocol HTTPS
	  to virtual addresses web servers are using from anywhere,
	  and limited access to the webmin port on a specific
	  address.</para>

	  <para>Here is the firewall object:</para>

	<para>Here are the policy rules:</para>

        </figure>

	  <para> Access to webmin service is only permitted from the
	  local network, while access to the secure web servers
	  running on virtual addresses fxp0-ip1, fxp0-ip2 and fxp0-ip3
	  is permitted from anywhere.</para>

	  <para>The following screenshot illustrates how the TCP
	  Service object webmin is created.</para>

        <figure id="ex2-server-3">
          <title>webmin object</title>
              <graphic scale="50" fileref="ex2-server-3.png" />
        </figure>

	<para>Webmin uses port 10000, so we put this port number in
	both the beginning and end of the destination port range. We
	do not need to do any inspection of the TCP flags and leave
	all of them unchecked in this object.</para>
