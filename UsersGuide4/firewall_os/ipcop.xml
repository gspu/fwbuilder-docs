      Firewall Builder v4.0 comes with experimental integration with
      <emphasis>IPCOP</emphasis> firewalls. To turn it on, choose
      platform <emphasis>"iptables"</emphasis> and host
      OS <emphasis>"IPCOP firewall appliance"</emphasis>. Generated
      script is supposed to be installed on the firewall as
      <command>/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall.local</command> and restarted by the command
      <command>"/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall restart"</command>. Built-in
      policy installer in Firewall Builder GUI installs it using this
      name and runs restart command to activate it. Firewall Builder
      does not manage interfaces of IPCOP firewall to avoid conflicts
      with IPCOP itself. Use fwbuilder only to generate iptables
      rules. The program comes with some template objects for IPCOP
      firewalls, you can use them when you create new Firewall object
      if you choose to create it from a template.

      Iptables script for IPCOP is built using configlets in
      <emphasis>/usr/share/fwbuilder-4.0.0/configlets/ipcop</emphasis>.
      Commands used by the built-in policy installer come from
      configlets in the same directory.
