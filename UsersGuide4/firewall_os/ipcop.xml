      Firewall Builder v4.0 comes with experimental integration with
      <emphasis>IPCOP</emphasis> firewalls. To turn this support on, choose
      <emphasis>"iptables"</emphasis> as the platform and <emphasis>"IPCOP firewall appliance"</emphasis> as the host
      OS. The generated
      script is supposed to be installed on the firewall as
      <command>/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall.local</command> and restarted by issuing the 
      <command>/etc/rc.d/rc.firewall restart</command> command. Firewall Builder's built-in
      policy installer installs it using this
      name and runs the <command>restart</command> command to activate it. To avoid conflicts
      with IPCOP itself, Firewall Builder
      does not manage the interfaces of the IPCOP firewall. Instead, use Firewall Builder only to generate the iptables
      rules. Firewall Builder comes with some template objects for IPCOP
      firewalls; you can use these objects when you create a new firewall object
      if you choose to create it from a template.

      The iptables script for IPCOP is built using configlets in the
      <emphasis>/usr/share/fwbuilder-4.0.0/configlets/ipcop</emphasis> directory.
      Commands used by the built-in policy installer come from
      configlets in the same directory.
