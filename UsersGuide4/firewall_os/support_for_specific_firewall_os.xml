  <title>Integration with OS running on the firewall machine</title>

  <para>
    Firewall Builder can generate firewall script in the format
    tailored for specific OS or distributions running on the
    firewall. This helps integrate generated firewall configuration
    with startup scripts and other parts of the system-wide
    configuration of the OS running on the firewall. As of v4.0,
    Firewall Builder comes with such support OpenWRT, DD-WRT and
    Sveasoft firmwares for small firewall appliances (Linksys, DLink
    and others), it also has experimental integration with IPCOP and
    derivatives. Integration with Secunet Wall firewall is provided
    and supported by Security Networks AG, Germany.

  <para>
    Script generated by fwbuilder can have different format or even
    add or skip certain parts depending on the chosen target firewall
    OS. You can switch from one OS to another using "Host OS" setting
    in the firewall object dialog.
