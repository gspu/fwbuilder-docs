    <para>
      Firewall platforms "pf", "ipfilter" and "ipfw" can be used with
      these OS.
    </para>

    <para>
      For <emphasis>PF</emphasis>, Firewall Builder generates .conf
      configuration file and .fw policy activation script. Both files
      have the name the same as the name of the firewall object by
      default, but you can change this in the "Compiler" tab of the
      firewall settings dialog.
    </para>

    <para>
      For <emphasis>ipfilter</emphasis> Firewall Builder generates
      three files: the firewall-ipf.conf file with filter rules,
      firewall-nat.conf file with NAT rules and firewall.fw with
      policy activation script.
    </para>

    <para>
      For <emphasis>ipfw</emphasis> a single script firewall.fw is
      generated, this script does all the prepararory work and then
      loads ipfw rules.
    </para>

    <para>
      By default, generated scripts are installed in the /etc/fw/
      directory on the firewall and the work of making sure they are
      executed on system start-up is left for the administrator. See
      <xref linkend="load_policy_on_reboot"/> for some recommended
      ways to do this.
