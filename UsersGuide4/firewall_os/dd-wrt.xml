    <para>
      To use Firewall Builder
      with <ulink url="http://www.dd-wrt.com/">DD-WRT</ulink>,
      configure the firewall object with host OS <emphasis>"DD-WRT
      (nvram)"</emphasis> or <emphasis>"DD-WRT (jffs)"</emphasis>.
      These two settings define the activation method used by the
      built-in policy installer, it can either store generated script
      in nvram or in jffs (journaling flash file system).

      <title>DD-WRT (nvram)</title>

      <para>
        In this mode generated script is shorter and does not support
        command-line
        arguments <command>"start"</command>, <command>"stop"</command>, <command>"status"</command>. The
        script does not try to load iptables modules on the firewall
        but configures inetrface addresses, vlans, bridge ports and
        bonding interfaces. When you set host OS of the firewall
        object to "DD-WRT (nvram)", built-in policy installer saves
        the script in nvram variable <emphasis>"fwb"</emphasis> and
        configures nvram variable
        <emphasis>"rc_firewall"</emphasis> to run this script.
      </para>

      <para>
        Generated script is assembled from parts defined in configlets
        located
        in directory <emphasis>/usr/share/fwbuilder-4.0.0/configlets/dd-wrt-nvram/</emphasis>.
        You can modify it following instructions in
        <xref linkend="configlets"/>.

      <para>
        First of all, activate JFFS/JFFS2 (Journaling Flash File
        System) on the firewall. Instructions are provided in the
        <ulink url="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Journalling_Flash_File_System">DD-WRT
        wiki</ulink>. Once jffs is mounted read-write, create
        directory <emphasis>"/jffs/firewall"</emphasis> where
        fwbuilder will store generated script. This is explained in
        this article <ulink url="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Firewall_Builder">in
        DD-WRT wiki</ulink>.
      </para>

      <para>
        When the firewall is configured with host OS <emphasis>"DD-WRT
        (jffs)"</emphasis>, built-in policy installer copies generated
        script to the
        file <emphasis>"/jffs/firewall/firewall.fs"</emphasis> on the
        firewall and configures nvram
        variable <emphasis>"rc_firewall"</emphasis> to call this
        script. In the older versions of Firewall Builder you had to
        configure the program manually to do these steps
        per <ulink url="http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Firewall_Builder">in
        DD-WRT wiki</ulink>. Firewall Builder 4.0 implements this
        configuration out of the box.
      </para>

      <para>
        The generated script is assembled from parts defined in configlets
        located
        in directory <emphasis>/usr/share/fwbuilder-4.0.0/configlets/dd-wrt-jffs/</emphasis>.
        You can modify it following instructions in
        <xref linkend="configlets"/>.
      </para>

      <note>
        <para>
          Recent builds of DD-WRT (tested with v24 and v24SP1) seem to
          disable JFFS for some reason. If you plan to use the jffs method
          of installing firewall script, check if the version you run
          supports it.
