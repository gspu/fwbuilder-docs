      Another firmware for the firewall apliances such as Linksys,
      DLink and others supported by Firewall Builder
      is <ulink url="http://sveasoft.com/">Sveasoft</ulink>.
    </para>

    <para>
      The difference here is both in the generated script format and
      in commands that built-in policy installer executes on the
      firewall. The reason for these differences is that Sveasoft
      stores firewall configuration in NVRAM which has limited
      capacity.

    <para>
      Script generated for the Sveasoft firmware is more compact and
      is missing certain sections. For example, since the kernel has
      all modules compiled in, the script is not trying to load
      modules. The script also activates the policy when called
      without command line parameters. Script structure is defined in
      the
      configlet <emphasis>/usr/share/fwbuilder-4.0.0/configlets/sveasoft/script_skeleton</emphasis>.
      You can modify it following instructions in
      <xref linkend="configlets"/>.
    </para>

    <para>
      Activation process on Sveasfot is more complex because installer
      can compress firewall script before storing it in NVRAM. Installation
      commands are in the configlet <emphasis>/usr/share/fwbuilder-4.0.0/configlets/sveasoft/installer_commands_root</emphasis>.
