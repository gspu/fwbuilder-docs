  <title>Configlets</title>

  <para>
    Generated firewall scripts are assembled from fragments called
    "configlets." Each configlet is a template. The program replaces
    configlet macros with actual strings and values when it generates a
    firewall configuration. Normally, you don't need to think about
    them.
  </para>

  <para>
    However, if you have the need, you can use your own configlets or
    modify the existing ones. Using your own configlets, you can
    change virtually all aspects of generated configuration
    files.
  </para>

  <para>
    Default configlets are stored in
    "/usr/share/fwbuilder-4.0.0/configlets" on Linux,
    "C:\FWBuilder40\resources\configlets on Windows", and
    "fwbuilder400.app/Contents/Resources/configlets" on a Mac. If you
    create a "fwbuilder/configlets" directory in your home directory
    and place files with the same name there, Firewall Builder will
    use those configlets instead. You need to retain the structure of
    subdirectories inside this directory. For example, Linux
    configlets stored in "$HOME/fwbuilder/configlets/linux24" will
    override the configlets installed in
    "/usr/share/fwbuilder/configlets/linux24".
  </para>

  <para>
    Configlets provide the commands the built-in policy installer
    needs to install the policy on the firewall. Two configlets are
    used for Unix-based firewalls (Linux, OpenWRT, Sveasoft, IPCOP and
    its variants, OpenBSD, FreeBSD, MacOSX, Solaris):
    "installer_commands_reg_user" and "installer_commands_root". You
    can change the behavior of the installer without having to touch
    C++ code, just create a copy of the configlet file in
    $HOME/fwbuilder/configlets and modify it.
