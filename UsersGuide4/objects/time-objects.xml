    <title>Time Interval Objects</title>

      <para>Time Interval objects allow you to create a rule that only
      matches during certain periods of time, such as on weekend days,
      during work hours, or other periods. Time intervals operate
      based on the time as known <emphasis>by the firewall
      device</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>Time intervals can be certain days of the week (only on
      Mondays, for example), only certain times, and/or only during a
      certain range of dates. You can combine these options to create
      an object that represents, for example, Tuesday afternoons from
      1 to 3 PM during March of 2011.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Start date checkbox:</para>

            <para>Indicates that the time interval has a starting

          <listitem>
            <para>Start time:</para>

            <para>Indicates the beginning of the daily interval. Only

            specified) and before <guilabel>End date</guilabel> (if
            specified) and on indicated days of the week. For example,

            <para>End date checkbox:</para>

            <para>Indicates that the time interval has an ending

          <listitem>

            <para>Indicates the end of the daily interval. Only

            <para>Indicates on which days of the week the time
            interval should be applicable. For example,
            if <guilabel>Mon</guilabel> is checked
            and <guilabel>Tue</guilabel> is not, then the time
            interval object will apply to Mondays, but not

	<para>In <xref linkend="time-interval2" />, the object would
	be valid from the beginning of Dec. 19, 2009 and end the
	beginning of Jan. 4, 2010. This would hypothetically
	correspond to a "winter break" at some institution when access
	to some networks would be restricted.</para>

	<para>Another possibility is to limit recreational activities to non-work hours.</para>

      <para>In this rule, the "quake" protocol is allowed from the
      internal network after hours and during weekends. Otherwise, the
      final "deny all" rule in the rule set would prevent it during
      other times (during work hours).</para>
