    <title>How to use Firewall Builder to configure the firewall using PPPoE</title>

    <para>
    If your Internet connection uses the PPPoE protocol, then 
    your firewall should be configured with interface ppp0.
    </para>

    <para>
    With PPPoE, the connection is established using the PPP protocol 
    that works on top of the usual Ethernet. As the result, the firewall 
    gets interface ppp0 in addition to the interfaces eth0 and eth1 that 
    correspond to its "normal" physical network adapters. Here is how you 
    can use Firewall Builder to configure such a firewall (assuming 
    interface eth0 is connected to the DSL link and eth1 is connected 
    to internal LAN):

        Add interfaces ppp0 and eth1. You can simply skip eth0 as it does not 
        have an IP address and never sees IP packets.

        If you have a static IP address with your Internet connection, mark 
        ppp0 as "static" and add an address object to it. Configure the 
        address object with the IP address.

        If your Internet connection uses dynamic IP address, mark ppp0 as 
        "dynamic" and do not add an address object to it. Create script 
        /etc/ppp/ip-up to restart the firewall every time IP address of 
        ppp0 changes.
