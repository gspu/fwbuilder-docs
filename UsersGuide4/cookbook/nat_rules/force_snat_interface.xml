          <title>Using the Address of "wrong" Interface for Source Address
          Translation</title>

          <para>
            Normally, a generated iptables SNAT rule includes a "-o
            &lt;interface&gt;" clause to make it more specific and
            only translate packets that really leave the
            network. Firewall Builder guesses which interface to put
            in the "-o" parameter by looking at the object in the
            Translated Source of the NAT rule. If this object is the
            firewall's interface or an address of one of its
            interfaces, then it uses that interface for the "-o"
            parameter. There is one configuration that requires the
            "-o" parameter to be different from the address used for
            SNAT translation. This configuration is useful when you
            have small block of publicly routable addresses and want
            to host a server in DMZ, but the block is so small that
            subnetting it does not make sense.

        <para>
          Here the publicly routable address block is very small,
          it is just a /29 (6 usable addresses). It is assigned
          to the DMZ interface <emphasis>eth2</emphasis>, and the firewall's address
          is 192.0.2.1. The outside interface <emphasis>eth0</emphasis> can
          be either dynamic or have private address. In fact,
          this is a rather typical configuration for when your
          firewall is behind a DSL router and segment between
          the firewall and the router uses private addresses
          such as 192.168.1.0. It is more useful to keep that
          segment private and allocate all routable addresses
          to the DMZ instead of trying to subnet the routable
          subnet. The problem now is that a source address
          translation rule should use address that belongs to
          the DMZ interface <emphasis>eth2</emphasis> but "-o" parameter
          should use interface <emphasis>eth0</emphasis> or should be
          omitted all together. The "-o eth2" would not work
          at all.

        <para>
          To do this in Firewall Builder, create an address
          object with an IP address equivalent to the one you
          want to use for source NAT. Since in this example we
          want to use address 192.0.2.1 which belongs to the
          firewall, we call this new address object "like
          fw-1-1:eth2:ip". This is just a regular IPv4 address
          object; there is nothing special about it:

          Now we use it in the NAT rule:

          Here is what Firewall Builder generates for iptables for
          this rule:

        <programlisting>
# Rule 0 (NAT)
# 
$IPTABLES -t nat -A POSTROUTING -o eth+  -s 172.16.22.0/24 -j SNAT --to-source 192.0.2.1 
        </programlisting>

        <para>
          Compiler added "-o eth+" parameter that matches any
          outbound interface and used address 192.0.2.1 in
          SNAT target as required.
