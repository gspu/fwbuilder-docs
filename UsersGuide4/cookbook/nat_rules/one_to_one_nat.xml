          Examples above were "hiding" multiple internal addresses
          behind just one external address. We a had whole network
          (potentially 254 hosts) use the same external address to
          access the Internet. Sometimes it is necessary to do
          translation where each internal host has a dedicated
          corresponding address on the outside.  This is often called
          "1-1" NAT. Here is how this is done in fwbuilder when a
          whole network of the same dimension is available on the
          outside:

        <para>
          Network object <emphasis>ext net</emphasis> defines network
          "192.0.2.0/24", which is the same size as the internal
          network (this is a hypothetical example). Here is iptables
          command produced for this rule:
        </para>

        <programlisting>

# Rule 0 (NAT)
# 
$IPTABLES -t nat -A POSTROUTING   -s 172.16.22.0/24 -j NETMAP --to 192.0.2.0/24 

        </programlisting>

        <para>
          NETMAP target maps a whole network of addresses onto another
          network of addresses.

        <para>
          In PF the following "nat" command is used:
        </para>

        <programlisting>

# Rule  0 (NAT)
# 
nat proto {tcp udp icmp} from 172.16.22.0/24 to any -&gt; 192.0.2.0/24 

        </programlisting>

        <para>
          For PIX, fwbuilder generates a "global" address pool the
          size of the 192.0.2.0/24 network:
        </para>

        <programlisting>

! Rule  0 (NAT)
