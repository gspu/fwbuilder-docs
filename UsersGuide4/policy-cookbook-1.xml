      <title>Firewall object used in examples</title>

      <para>
        We start with the firewall object that looks like shown on
        <xref linkend="policy-examples-linux-fw" />. This firewall has
        three interfaces: eth0 (outside), eth1 (inside) and loopback.
        All addresses are assigned statically. Address of the inside
        interface "eth1" is 192.168.1.1/24, we also have network
        object with name "net-192.168.1.0" that defines internal
        network 192.168.1.0/24.
      </para>

      <para>
        To illustrate generated configurations for platforms other
        than iptables/Linux in this chapter, I am using similarly
        configured firewall objects with different platform and host
        OS settings.
