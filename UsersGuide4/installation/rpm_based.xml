      <para>Using pre-built binary RPMs</para>

      <para>You need to download and install two RPMs:</para>

        </para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>To satisfy dependencies, you need the following packages installed on your system:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem><para>libxml2 v2.4.10 or newer
        </para></listitem>
        <listitem><para>libxslt v1.0.7 o newer

        <listitem><para>QT 4.3.x, 4.4.x, 4.5.x, 4.6.x. Firewall Builder uses
            features available in QT 4.3 and later; the system does not support version 4.2 and earlier.
        </para></listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
        <para>Pre-built binary RPMs for RedHat Enterprise Linux 5 (RHEL 5) and CentOS 5.x</para>

        <para>These distributions do not come with QT4, and third-party
          binary RPMs of QT v4.3.x and 4.4.x can be difficult to obtain. For these distributions, we
        distribute binary RPMs of Firewall Builder 4.0 statically
        linked with QT 4.4.1. These RPMs are
        posted in the Downloads area of the SourceForge project
        site. These RPMs have the same standard
        names (<filename>libfwbuilder-4.0.0-1.i386.el5.rpm</filename>
        and <filename>fwbuilder-4.0.0-1.i386.el5.rpm</filename>), but they
         have no dependency on QT RPMs.</para>

      <para>If a Firewall Builder V3.0 distribution statically linked with QT crashes on start
        on your CentOS system, please upgrade to the latest version of Firewall Builder. If you 
        need to run Firewall Builder V3.0 please make sure you have the following font packages 
        installed: <filename>bitmap-fonts</filename> or <filename>bitstream-vera-fonts</filename>. 
        Either one resolve the issue and will enable Firewall Builder to work.
      </para>

      <para>To install Firewall Builder, navigate to your download directory
      and execute the following command (replacing the filenames with the
      names of the files you actually downloaded):</para>

      <programlisting>rpm -i libfwbuilder-4.0.0-1.i386.rpm fwbuilder-4.0.0-1.i386.rpm</programlisting>
