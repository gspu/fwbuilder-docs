      <title>Installing FreeBSD and OpenBSD Ports</title>

      <para>Firewall Builder consists of two
      ports: <filename>/usr/ports/security/libfwbuilder</filename>
      and <filename>/usr/ports/security/fwbuilder</filename>. Once
      both ports are updated (it usually takes couple of weeks to
      update ports after the package is released), just install the
      port as usual using portinstall or issuing "make install"
      in <filename>/usr/ports/security/fwbuilder</filename>.</para>
