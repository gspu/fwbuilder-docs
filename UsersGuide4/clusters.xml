    <title>Cluster configuration</title>

    <para>
      Firewall Builder 4.0 introduces support for firewall
      clusters. Firewall Builder helps you create configuration for
      iptables, PF or PIX rules and in some cases cluster
      configuration as well. The following state synchronization and
      failover protocols are supported at this time:

      Firewall Builder automatically generates policy rules to permit
      packets of these protocols when it sees firewall cluster
      configured with one of them. You can use cluster object and its
      interfaces instead of the member firewall objects or their
      interfaces in policy and NAT rules and the program will
      substitute correct addresses when it generates iptables script
      or PF or PIX configuration.

      <title>Linux cluster configuration with Firewall Builder</title>

      <para>
        Detailed walk-through examples for different Linux, BSD and

      <para>
        High Availability (HA) configurations on Linux can be built
        using different software packages, such as vrrpd
        (<ulink url="http://off.net/~jme/vrrpd/"><citetitle>VRRPD home
        page</citetitle></ulink>) or heartbeat
        (<ulink url="http://www.linux-ha.org/"><citetitle>Linux-HA
        home page</citetitle></ulink>). Firewall Builder focuses on
        the firewall configuration and provides independent way of
        configuring iptables rules for Linux HA clusters and can be
        used with any HA software package, including home-grown
        scripts and packages that will appear in the future. At this
        time Firewall Builder does not generate configuration or
        command line for the HA software.

      <para>
        Like with all other supported firewall platforms, interface
        objects that belong to a cluster object serve to establish
        association between actual interfaces of the member
        firewalls. Cluster interface object should have the same
        name as corresponding member firewall interfaces. It should
        have Failover Group child object configured with interfaces
        of the member firewalls. You can create Failover Group
        object using context menu item "Add Failover Group", the
        menu appears when you right mouse click on the cluster
        interface object. If you create new cluster using "New
        object" menu or toolbar button, the wizard that creates new
        cluster object will create Failober Group objects
        automatically. Here is how it should look like:
      </para>

        </figure>
      </para>

      <para>
        Note that the name of the cluster interface should match
        the name of the member interfaces exactly, even if it may
        appear that HA software running on the firewall creates
        new interface such as eth0:0. Heartbeat daemon creates
        what looks like interface "eth0:0" when it becomes active
        and assumes virtual ip address. The "eth0:0" is in fact a
        label on the secondary ip address on the interface "eth0"
        which you can see if you use command "ip addr show dev
        eth0". Here is an example of the output of this command
        taken on the firewall running heartbeat that was active at
        the moment:

      <para>
        Secondary IP address 10.3.14.150 that was added by
        heartbeat is highlighted in red. The "eth0:0" at the very
        end of the output is the label assigned to this address,
        this label makes it appear as another inetrface in the
        output of ifconfig, however it is not real inetrface. Here
        is the output of ifconfig on the same machine at the same
        time when it was active in the HA pair:

      <para>
        It is important to understand the distinction because
        iptables does not recognize eth0:0 as an interface and does
        not allow it in "-i" or "-o" clause. Firewall Builder
        follows the same rules as the target firewall platform it
        prepares configuration for. This means you should build
        configuration in fwbuilder using interface "eth0" and not
        "eth0:0".

        Each cluster interface should have a Failover Group child

        Firewall Builder only supports multicast or unicast
        heartbeat configuration. You can enter the address and port
        number in the dialog. If you turn checkbox "Use unicast
        address" on, generated iptables commands will match source
        and destination addresses of the corresponding interface of
        both member firewalls. If this checkbox is off, it is
        assumed heartbeat is configured to use multicast and
        generated iptables commands will only match this multicast
        address in both INPUT and OUTPUT chains.
      </para>

      <para>
        As with heartbeat, you can configure ip address and port
        number for the OpenAIS protocol. There is no unicast option

        Cluster object should also have State Synchronization group
        child object. Create it using context menu "Add State
        Synchronization Group" item if this object does not
        exist. In this object you need to configure member
        interfaces that should be used for state synchronization. On
        Linux, state synchronization is done using conntrackd daemon
        (<ulink url="http://conntrack-tools.netfilter.org/"><citetitle>conntrack-tools
            home page</citetitle></ulink>). Configure State

      <para>
        Member firewalls and their inetrfaces appear in the panel in
        the right hand side of the dialog. Firewall Builder uses
        this information to automatically generate iptables rules to
        permit conntrackd packets. Firewall Builder assumes
        conntrackd is configured to send synchronization packets
        over dedicated interface (which generally is a good idea
        anyway). You may use internal inetrface of the firewall for
        this purpose as well. See examples of conntrackd
        configuration in Firewall Builder CookBook. You can configure
        ip address and port number for the conntrack as well.

      <title>PIX cluster configuration with Firewall Builder</title>

      <para>
        Firewall Builder supports PIX "lan based" failover configuration.
        Unlike in Linux or BSD, where each interface of the firewall runs
        its own instance of failover protocol, PIX runs one instance of
        failover protocol over dedicated interface. PIX can also run state
        synchronization protocol over the same or another dedicated
        interface. These dedicated interfaces should be connected via
        separate switch and do not see regular traffic. Here is how this is
        implemented in Firewall Builder:
      </para>


      <para>
        Like with all other supported firewall platforms, interface
        objects that belong to a cluster object serve to establish
        association between actual interfaces of the member
        firewalls. Cluster interface object should have the same name as
        corresponding member firewall interfaces. It should have
        Failover Group child object which should be configured with
        interfaces of the member firewalls. You can create Failover
        Group object using context menu item "Add Failover Group", the
        menu appears when you right mouse click on the cluster interface
        object. Here is an example of correct interface mapping between
        cluster and member firewalls:

      </para>

      <para>
        The Failover Group object "cluster1:e0.101:members" is
        configured with interfaces "Ethernet0.101" of both members:

        </figure>
      </para>

      <para>
        Interface that is configured for the failover on the member
        firewall should be marked as "Dedicated Failover". Use checkbox
        with this name in the interface object dialog to do this.
      </para>

      <para>
        Cluster interface that corresponds to the failover interface
        of the members should be configured with protocol "PIX
        failover protocol". Click on the "Edit protocol parameters"
        button to edit timeout, poll time and the key.
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Cluster interfaces that represent regular interfaces of the
        members also must have failover group objects; that is where
        you add interfaces of the member firewalls. There is no need
        to configure protocol in these failover groups because PIX
        does not run it over these interfaces. Regular interfaces
        should not be marked as "Dedicated Failover".
      </para>
      
      <para>
        Cluster object should have State Synchronization group child
        object. Create it using context menu "Add State
        Synchronization Group" item if this object does not
        exist. In this object you need to configure member
        interfaces that should be used for state
        synchronization. You can use separate dedicated interfaces
        or the same interfaces used for failover. If these are
        separate, corresponding interface objects of the member
        firewalls must be marked as "Dedicated Failover".
      </para>

      <para>
        One of the member firewall interfaces used in the State
        Synchronization group must be marked as "master". This is
        where you define which PIX unit is going to be the primary
        and which is going to be the secondary in the HA pair.
