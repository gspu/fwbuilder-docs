      <title>Using Address Range instead of a group</title>


      <para>
        In the example above, three hosts used for the
        group <emphasis>"management hosts"</emphasis> have consecutive
        addresses 192.168.1.110, 192.168.1.111,
        192.168.1.112. Although this example may be artificial, it
        allows us to illustrate how a different type of object could
        be used to achieve the same goal - to permit access to the
        firewall from these three addresses. The difference may be
        negligible when we deal with just three addresses, but when
        the list gets into hundreds it may become significant.
      </para>

      <para>
        Since addresses of the management hosts are consecutive, we
        can use Address Range object to describe them:
      </para>

      <figure id="address-range-obj-1">
        <title>Policy for server</title>
        <graphic scale="50" fileref="policy-rule-address-range-object.png" />
      </figure>

      <para>
        We use this object in the rule just like any other
        object. <xref linkend="policy-rule-with-address-range-obj"/> shows the rule:
      </para>

      <figure id="policy-rule-with-address-range-obj">
        <title>Policy for server</title>
        <graphic scale="50" fileref="policy-rule-with-address-range.png" />
      </figure>

      <para>
        The main difference in generated code for the rule using
        Address Range compared to the rule using collection of
        individual addresses is that compiler is allowed to optimize
        it. It tries to squeeze the address range to the minimal set
        of address and network objects. Here is how it looks like for
        iptables:
      </para>

      <programlisting>
# Rule 0 (global)
# 
$IPTABLES -A INPUT  -s 192.168.1.110/31   -m state --state NEW  -j ACCEPT 
$IPTABLES -A INPUT  -s 192.168.1.112   -m state --state NEW  -j ACCEPT 
      </programlisting>

      <para>
        Again, the difference may not be very great when we have only
        three ip addresses, but in case of a range that spans hundred
        addresses the performance gain and reduction in the size of
        generated script are significant.
      </para>

      <para>
        Generated PF and PIX configurations look similar.
      </para>
