        <title>Plink.exe fails while trying to activate the firewall policy with an error 'Looking up host ""
          Connecting to 0.0.0.0 port 22'</title>

          This only happens when Firewall Builder GUI runs on
          Windows and uses pscp.exe and plink.exe to transfer
          generated firewall script and activate it on the firewall
          machine. Utilities pscp.exe and plink.exe are part of the
          PuTTY package by Simon
          Tatham <ulink url="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</ulink>.

          Fwbuilder GUI launches plink.exe utility to log in to the
          firewall machine and activate firewall script there. It
          composes plink.exe command line using ip address of the
          firewall and adds command line option "-ssh" to force
          plink.exe to use ssh protocol. Plink.exe and GUI ssh
          client putty.exe share the same configuration stored in
          windows registry and if default settings configured in
          putty.exe set default protocol to "Serial" as shown in
          the screenshot below, plink.exe seems to ignore command
          line option "-ssh" and fails with an error 'Looking up
          host "" Connecting to 0.0.0.0 port 22'. Just set default
          protocol to "ssh" using putty configuration dialog.
