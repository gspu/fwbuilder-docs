        <title>autogen.sh Complains "libfwbuilder not installed"</title>

        <para><emphasis>When compiling from source, autogen.sh complains "libfwbuilder
        not installed"</emphasis></para>

        <para>As of version 0.9.6 the code has been split into three major
        parts: API, GUI and policy compilers. You need to download, compile
        and install API for the rest to compile. The API comes in a separate
        source archive called libfwbuilder-0.10.0.tar.gz. Compile and install
        it as usual, using "./autogen.sh; make; make install"
        procedure.</para>

        <title>"Failed dependencies: ..." when installing RPM</title>

        <para><emphasis>Trying to install Firewall Builder RPM but I get a bunch of errors
        "Failed dependencies: ...". What do I need to do ?</emphasis></para>

        <para>You need to install prerequisite libraries. See the list of RPMs
        in the appendix.</para>

        <note><para>Do not use options "--force" or "--nodeps" when
        you install fwbuilder RPMs. If rpm complains about unsatisfied
        dependencies, this means your system is missing some libraries, or the
        wrong versions are installed. Forcing the package install won't fix
        that; most likely it will fail in one way or another.</para></note>
