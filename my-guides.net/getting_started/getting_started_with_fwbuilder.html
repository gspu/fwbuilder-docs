    This guide presents an introduction to Firewall
    Builder. <b>Firewall Builder</b> (also known as <b>fwbuilder</b>)
    is a GUI firewall configuration and management tool that
    supports <b>iptables</b>, <b>ipfilter</b>, <b>pf</b>, <b>ipfw</b>,
    <b>Cisco PIX</b> (FWSM, ASA) and <b>Cisco IOS</b> extended access
    lists. Both professional network administrators and hobbyists
    managing firewalls with policies more complex that is allowed by
    simple web based UI can simplify management tasks with the
    application. The program runs on <b>Linux</b>, <b>FreeBSD</b>,
    <b>OpenBSD</b>, <b>Windows</b> and <b>Mac OS X</b> and can manage
    both local and remote firewalls. This article is an introduction
    to the program.
  </p>


  <h3>Introduction</h3>

  <p>
    Everyone knows about netfilter/iptables, a powerful firewall
    framework and command line tool that is part of every Linux
    distribution. Unfortunately, managing security policy with it
    remains non-trivial task for several reasons. Partially this is
    because of the complex syntax of the command line interface and
    multitude of the available options and parameters. Another reason is
    that administrator has to understand internal path of the packet
    inside Linux kernel and its interaction with different parts of
    netfilter in order to build rules correctly.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is not a problem specific to iptables though, other popular
    Open Source and commercial firewall platforms, such as OpenBSD PF,
    ipfilter, ipfw, Cisco PIX and IOS present similar challenges. Even
    experienced administrators who spend a lot of time writing
    firewall policies or access lists for these make mistakes
    sometimes. Unfortunately, such mistakes often cause outages and end
    up rather costly. Automatic configuration generation reduces
    probability of human error caused by a typo or misunderstanding of
    the syntax or internal structure of the target firewall platform.
  </p>

  <p>
    What is needed is a tool that could let administrator define
    security policy on a higher level of abstraction and hide internal
    structure of the target firewall platform. For example, such tool
    should decide which iptables chain is right for each generated
    iptables rule automatically, without administrator's input. It
    should also pick the right iptables targets for both policy and NAT
    (Network Address Translation) rules as well as properly use most
    popular iptables modules, all automatically. Such tool should also
    implement best practices in policy design and help administrator
    deploy and activate generated policy on the firewall.
  </p>

  <p>
    Firewall Builder does just that.
  </p>



  <h3>Installation and Running the Program</h3>

  <p>
    Firewall Builder comes in packages <b>libfwbuilder</b> (supporting
    API library) and <b>fwbuilder</b> (the GUI and policy compilers),
    these packages can be found in Networking (Universe) on Debian and
    Ubuntu and in "extras" on Fedora Linux. 
  </p>

  <pre>
    # aptitude install libfwbuilder fwbuilder
  </pre>

  <p>
    Once installed, it is available
    under <em>"System/Administration"</em> menu.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_011.png">

  <p>
    On FreeBSD and OpenBSD Firewall Builder is part of
    ports, you can find it in <b>/usr/ports/security/fwbuilder</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Packages shipping with Ubuntu are always one or two minor
    revisions behind. If you want to try the latest version, you can
    use pre-built binary <em>.deb</em> packages offered on the
    project's web site or build from source using our
    online <a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/guides/firewall_builder_installation.html">installation
    instructions</a>. Pre-built binary packages can be installed using
    <a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/docs/firewall_builder_packages.html">
    Firewall Builder repositories of rpm and deb packages</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the system menu item is not there or you have built the program
    from source, you can always launch it from the command line by
    just typing "fwbuilder" on the shell prompt:
  </p>

  <pre>
    $ fwbuilder
  </pre>

  <p>
    The program starts and opens main window and greeting dialog. The
    dialog provides links to the project web site where you can find
    more tutorials, FAQ, Firewall Builder Cookbook and other
    documentation, as well as bug tracking system and links to user
    forums and mailing list. Clicking on the link in the dialog opens
    corresponding web page in your web browser. This works the same on
    all supported OS: Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. You can always open
    this dialog later using an item in the main menu "Help".
  </p>

  <img src="pict_010.png">

  <h3>Creating Firewall Object</h3>

  <p>
    Lets create our first firewall object. To do this, we'll use
    object creation menu that appears when you click on the icon in
    the small toolbar right above the object tree. Choose menu item
    "New Firewall" from the menu that appears.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_020.png">

  <p>
    The program presents wizard-like dialog that will guide you
    through the process of creation of the new firewall object.  In
    the first page of the wizard you can enter the name for the new
    firewall object (here it is "guardian"), its platform ("iptables")
    and host OS ("Linux").
  </p>

  <p>
    There are two ways new firewall can be created: you can use one of
    the preconfigured template firewall objects or create it from
    scratch. This tutorial demonstrates the first method (using
    template object). To do this, check checkbox "Use preconfigured
    template firewall objects". Template can be taken from the library
    of template objects that comes with Firewall Builder package or
    from a file provided by the user. The latter is useful when
    administrator wants to distribute a library of predefined
    templates to other users in the enterprise. We are using one of
    the standard templates in this guide and therefore leave
    standard template library path and name in the "Template file:"
    input field. Click "Next" to move on to the next page of the
    wizard.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that template firewall object comes completely configured,
    including addresses and netmasks of its interfaces and some basic
    policy and NAT rules. This configuration is intended as a starting
    point only. You should reconfigure addresses of interfaces to
    match those used on your network and most likely will have to
    adjust rules to match your security policy.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_030.png">

  <p>
    This page of the wizard shows template objects and their
    configuration. Standard template objects represent firewalls with
    two or three interfaces, a host with one interface, web server or
    Cisco router. Choose firewall with three interfaces for this
    guide. Note that template comes with completely configured
    firewall object, including set of interfaces and their ip
    addresses and some basic firewall policy. You will see how
    addresses can be changed later on in this guide. Click "Finish" to
    create a new firewall object using chosen template.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_040.png">

  <p>
    Here is our new firewall object. Its name is <b>guardian</b>, it
    appears in the object tree in the left hand side of the main
    window in the folder <b>Firewalls</b>. When an object is selected
    in the tree, a brief summary of its properties appears in the
    panel under the tree. Double-clicking on the object in the tree
    opens it in the editor panel at the bottom of the right hand side
    panel of the main window. The editor for the firewall object
    allows the user to change its name, platform and host OS and also
    provides buttons that open dialogs for "advanced" settings for the
    firewall platform and host OS. We will inspect these little later
    in this tutorial.
  </p>

  <p>
    You can always resize the main window to make all columns of the
    policy view be visible.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_050.png">

  <p>
    Now would be a good time to save the data to a disk file. This is
    done in a usual way using main menu <b>File/Save As</b>.
  </p>

  <h3>Overview of the Address and Service Objects</h3>

  <p>
    Lets take a little tour of the network and service objects that
    come standard with the program. You can use these preconfigured
    objects to build policy and NAT rules for your firewall.
  </p>

  <p>
    Objects in the tree are organized in libraries, you can switch
    between libraries using drop-down menu above the tree. Firewall
    Builder comes with a collection of address, network, service and
    time interval objects in the library called "Standard". Lets take
    a look at them. Notice that the background color of the panel that
    shows objects tree depends on the chosen object library. This
    makes it easier to keep track of the library currently opened in
    the program. 
  </p>

  <img src="pict_060.png">

  <p>
    Folder <b>Objects/Hosts</b> contains few host objects used in
    standard firewall templates. Folder <b>Objects/Network</b>
    contains network objects that represent various standard address
    ranges and blocks, such as multicast, net 127/8, networks defined
    in RFC1918 and so on.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_070.png">

  <p>
    Firewall Builder also comes with extensive collection of TCP, UDP
    and ICMP service objects that describe commonly used
    protocols. This slide shows some TCP objects (all of them do not
    fit in the screenshot).
  </p>

  <img src="pict_080.png">

  <p>
    Here is an example of a simple TCP service. It defines source and
    destination port ranges (in this case source port range is not
    defined and there is only one destination port 80). TCP service
    object can also define any combination of tcp flags the firewall
    should inspect and also which ones of them should be set in order
    for a packet to match this object. In the case of the service
    "http" we do not need to define any flags.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_090.png">

  <p>
    Now lets take a look at the objects created as part of the new
    firewall object <b>guardian</b>. In order to do this, switch to
    the library <b>User</b> where this object was created. To open an
    object in the editor panel to inspect or change it, double click
    on it in the tree. Also, if you click on an object in the policy
    rule to select it, it will automatically open in the tree on the
    left.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_100.png">

  <p>
    First, the firewall object itself.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every object in fwbuilder has basic attributes such as its name
    and comment. Other attributes depend on the object type.
  </p>

  <p>
    Attributes of the firewall object include platform (can be
    iptables, pf, ipfilter, etc.), version (platform-depended) and
    host OS. Buttons <b>Host OS Settings</b> and <b>Firewall
    Settings</b> open dialogs with many additional attributes that
    depend on the firewall platform and host OS. More on these later.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_110.png">

  <p>
    Here are the choices for the firewall platform, version (for
    iptables) and host OS.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_103.png">

  <p>
    Interfaces of the firewall are represented by objects located
    below the Firewall object in the tree. We refer to them as
    "children" of the firewall object. This slide demonstrates
    properties of the interface eth0. To open it in the editor double
    click on it in the tree. If editor panel is already open and shows
    some object, it is sufficient to select new object in the tree to
    reveal it in the editor panel (no need to double click).
  </p>

  <p>
    IP and MAC addresses of interfaces are represented by child
    objects in the tree located below corresponding interface.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_120.png">

  <p>
    Interface object has several attributes that define its function,
    such as "Management interface", "external" etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name: the name of the interface object in Firewall Builder must
        match exactly the name of the interface of the firewall machine it
        represents. This will be something like "eth0", "eth1", "en0", "br0"
        and so on.</li>

      <li>Label: On most OS this ﬁeld is not used and serves the purpose of
        a descriptive label. Firewall Builder GUI uses a label, if it is not
        blank, to show interfaces in the tree. One of the suggested uses for
        this ﬁeld is to mark interfaces to reﬂect the network topology
        (’outside’, ’inside’) or the purpose (’web frontend’ or ’backup
        subnet’). The label is mandatory for Cisco PIX though, where it must
        reﬂect the network topology.</li>

      <li>"Management interface": Sometimes the host has several network
        interfaces in which case one of them can be marked as the ’management
        interface’. The management interface is used for all communication
        between Firewall Builder and the host.</li>

      <li>"External interface (insecure)": marks an interface that connects
        to the Internet.</li>

      <li>"Unprotected interface": marks interface to which fwbuilder should
        not assign any access lists (used only with Cisco IOS platform)</li>

      <li>"Regular Interface": Use this option if the interface has an IP
        address assigned to it manually.</li>

      <li>"Address is assigned dynamically": Use this option if the
        interface has a dynamic address (obtained by means of DHCP or PPP or
        another protocol); in this case an address is unknown at the moment
        when Firewall Builder generates the ﬁrewall policy. </li>

      <li>"Unnumbered interface": Use this option if the interface can never
        have an IP address, such as the ethernet interface used to run PPPoE
        communication on some ADSL connections, tunnel endpoint interface, or
        an interface on a bridging ﬁrewall. See below Section 5.3.1 for more
        detailed discussion of these different types of interfaces. </li>

      <li>"Bridge port": this option is used for port of bridged firewall.</li>

      <li>"Security level": security level of this interface, used only with
        Cisco PIX (ASA)</li>

      <li>"Network zone": network zone of this interface, used only with
        Cisco PIX (ASA). Network zone drop-down list shows all network objects
        and groups of addresses and networks present in the tree. Choose one
        of them to tell the compiler which networks and blocks of addresses
        can be reached through this interface. Compiler uses this information
        to decide which interface each ACL rule should be associated with
        based on the addresses used in the destination of the rule.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <img src="pict_130.png">

  <p>
    Here is IP address of interface eth0, external interface of the
    firewall. The address and netmask are attributes of the child
    object of the type "IPv4 address". Here the address is "192.0.2.1"
    and netmask "255.255.255.0". Button "DNS Lookup" can be used to
    determine ip address using DNS. The program runs DNS query for the
    "A" record for the name of the parent firewall object.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_140.png">



  <h3>Changing IP Addresses to Match Your Network</h3>

  <p>
    Lets look at the IP address of the internal interface of the
    firewall. The address used in the template is "192.168.1.1" with
    netmask "255.255.255.0". This is rather typical address used for
    small and home networks. Some commercial firewall appliances come
    preconfigured with this address.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_150.png">

  <p>
    If address <b>192.168.1.0/24</b> matches address of your local
    network, you can skip this part of the guide and move to the page
    4. Otherwise, you need to reconfigure the address of the internal
    interface of the firewall object that you just created in
    fwbuilder and also change address object used in the policy
    rules. Start with changing address attribute (and possibly
    netmask, if necessary) of the object <b>guardian:eth1:ip</b> as
    shown in the screenshot:
  </p>

  <img src="pict_160.png">

  <p>
    Now we need to change IP address used in the rules. To do this, we
    create new Network object with correct address and replace object
    <b>net-192.168.1.0</b> in all rules with this new network object.
  </p>

  <p>
    Use new object menu to create Network object.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_170.png">

  <p>
    New Network object is created with default name 'New Network' and
    IP address 0.0.0.0.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_180.png">

  <p>
    Edit object name and address, then hit "Apply".
  </p>

  <img src="pict_190.png">

  <p>
    Use menu Object / Find to activate search and replace dialog. The
    Find and Replace dialog opens at the bottom of the right hand side
    panel in the main window, below the policy rules view.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_200.png">

  <p>
    Locate object object <b>net-192.168.1.0</b> in any policy rule
    where it is used or in its location in the tree in
    library <b>Standard</b> and drag and drop it to the left object
    well in the search and replace dialog as shown on the screenshot:
  </p>
  
  <img src="pict_210.png">
  
  <p>
    Change the scope setting to "Policy of all firewalls". If you have
    many firewalls in the tree, use scope "policy of the opened
    firewall" instead.  Locate new Network object you just created in
    the tree and drag and drop it to the right object well in the
    search and replace dialog as shown on the screenshot:
  </p>

  <img src="pict_220.png">
  
  <p>
    Now hit "Replace all" button. Pop-up dialog should appear and
    report how many replacements the program had to make in all rules
    of the firewall. Note that the replacement is done not only in the
    policy rules, but in NAT rules as well.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_230.png">
  
  <p>
    Now that you have created a new object and replaced old network
    object with new one in all rules, do not forget to save data to a
    file using menu <b>File/Save</b>
  </p>



  <h3>Properties of the Firewall Object</h3>


  <p>
    Lets inspect properties of the firewall object. Double click on
    the firewall "guardian" in the tree to open it in the editor
    panel, then click "Firewall Settings" button in the editor. This
    opens new dialog that looks like this. Notice button "Help" in
    this dialog, clicking this button opens help as shown on the next
    slide.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_240.png">

  <p>
    Online help explains all attributes and parameters located in each
    tab of the firewall settings dialog. I encourage you to explore it
    as many parameters are important and affect generated iptables
    script in different ways.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next few screenshots show other tabs of the firewall settings
    dialog. You can find detailed explanations of all parameters in
    the online help.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_250.png">

  <p>
    This page defines various parameters for the built-in policy
    installer. Installer uses ssh client (pscp.exe and plink.exe on
    Windows) to transfer generated script to the firewall machine and
    activate it there.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_260.png">

  <p>
    User can define shell commands that will be included in the
    generated script at the beginning and in the end of it. These
    commands can do anything you want, such as configure some
    subsystems, set up routing etc.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_270.png">


  <p>
    Parameters for logging.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_280.png">



  <p>
    More options for the script generation. Notice that fwbuilder can
    produce iptables script in two formats: 1) as a shell script that
    calls iptables utility to add each rule one by one, or 2) it can
    use iptables-restore script to activate the whole policy at
    once. Other parameters are explained in the online help.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_290.png">



  <p>
    Starting with v3.0 Firewall Builder can generate both IPv4 and
    IPv6 policy. This tab controls the order in which they are added
    to the script if user defined rules for both address families in
    the Policy objects of the firewall.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_300.png">


  <h3>Default Policy Rules</h3>

  <p>
    Lets take a look at the policy of the template firewall. These
    rules are intended to be an example, a starting point to help you
    create your own policy quicker. Most likely you will want to
    modify them to suite your requirements. Explanation of the rules
    given here is rather brief because the goal of this guide was only
    to demonstrate how to use Firewall Builder. 
  </p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rule 0: this is an anti-spoofing rule. It block incoming
        packets with source address that matches addresses of the
        firewall or internal or DMZ networks. The rule is associated
        with outside interface and has direction set to
        "Inbound".</li>

      <li>Rule 1: this rule permits any packets on loopback
        interface. This is necessary because many services on the
        firewall machine communicate back to the same machine via
        loopback.</li>

      <li>Rule 2: permit ssh access from internal network to the
        firewall machine. Notice service object "ssh" in the column
        "Service". This object can be found in the Standard objects
        library, folder Services/TCP.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <img src="pict_310.png">


  <p>
    Policy rules belong to the object "Policy", which is a child
    object of the firewall and can be found in the tree right below
    it. As any other object in Firewall Builder, Policy object has
    some attributes that you can edit if you double click on it in the
    tree.
  </p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Policy can be either IPv4, or IPv4 or combined IPv4 and
        IPv6. In the latter case you can use a mix of IPv4 and IPv6
        address objects in the same policy (in different rules) and
        Firewall Builder will automatically figure out which one is
        which and will sort them out.
      </li>

      <li>
        Policy can translate to only mangle table, or a combination of
        filter and mangle tables. Again, in the latter case policy
        compiler decides which table to use based on the rule action
        and service object. Some actions, such as "Tag" (translates
        into iptables target MARK) go into mangle table.
      </li>

      <li>
        "Top ruleset" means that compiler will place generated
        iptables rules into built-in chains INPUT/OUTPUT/FORWARD. If
        policy is not marked as "top ruleset", generated rules will go
        into user-defined chain with the name the same as the name of
        the policy object.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>


  <img src="pict_320.png">

  <p>
    Here are preconfigured NAT rules.
  </p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Rule 0: tells the firewall that no address translation
      should be done for packets coming from network 192.168.2.0 going
      to 192.168.1.0 (because Translated Source, Translated
      Destination and Translated Service are left empty)
      </li>

      <li>Rule 1: packets coming to the firewall from internal and DMZ
      networks should be translated so that source address will change
      and become that of the outside interface of the firewall.
      </li>

      <li>Rule 2: packets coming from the Internet to the interface
      "outside" will be translated and forwarded to the internal
      server on DMZ represented by the host object "server on dmz".
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>


  <img src="pict_330.png">

  <h3>Generating iptables script using fwbuilder policy compiler</h3>

  <p>
    Now we should be ready to compile policy of the
    firewall <b>guardian</b> and generate iptables script. To do this,
    select firewall in the tree and click right mouse button. Choose
    item "Compile" in the pop-up menu. The dialog that appears lists
    all firewall objects defined in the objects tree and lets you
    select which ones should be compiled. The firewall <b>guardian</b>
    has just been created and has never been compiled and dialog shows
    that. Make sure checkbox next to the firewall
    object <b>guardian</b> is checked and click button <b>"Next"</b>.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_340.png">

  <p>
    Firewall Builder calls policy compiler (which is by the way an

    Compiler generates iptables script in the file with the name the
    same as the name of the firewall object, with extension ".fw". The
    file is placed in the same directory where the data file .fwb is
    located.

 $ ls -la test2.fwb guardian.fw
-rwxr-xr-x 1 vadim vadim 11253 2009-02-16 16:41 guardian.fw

    Here is how generated script looks like. This is just a fragment
    from the middle to show some generated iptables commands.

  <h3>Installing Generated Script on the Firewall</h3>

  <p>
    Now you can transfer it to the firewall and execute it there to
    install iptables rules. However it is much more convenient to use
    built-in policy installer to do this. To use installer, click
    right mouse button on the firewall object in the tree and use menu
    item <b>Install</b>. Firewall Builder will compile the policy if
    necessary and then open dialog where you can configure parameters
    of the installer. Here you need to enter password to authenticate
    to the firewall. Once you click <b>OK</b>, installer will connect
    to the firewall using ssh client. First, it will copy generated
    script to the directory <b>/etc</b> on the firewall (or different
    one, if configured in the <b>Installer</b> tab of firewall
    settings dialog), then it will run this script and check for
    errors. Its progress will be visible in the panel of the installer
    wizard, just like the progress of policy compiler.

    This guide walked you step by step through the process of creating
    of a firewall object, making some minor changes in its parameters
    and policy rules, compiling the policy and activating it on the
    firewall machine. This guide did not touch advanced topics such as
    built-in revision control system, working with multiple data
    files, working with multiple firewall objects, IPv6. You can find
    documentation and guides on these topics and more on our project
