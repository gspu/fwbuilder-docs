  <title>How Firewall Builder works with Linux iptables firewalls</title>

  <para>
  Conceptually Firewall Builder works the same way no matter what type of 
  firewall is being configured. Firewall Builder is based on the idea of 
  using objects to represent rule elements, such as IP networks Host 
  addresses, and then using these objects to define firewalll rules.
  </para>

  <para>
  For Linux iptables firewalls after the firewall rules have been created 
  Firewall Builder will generate a shell script file that includes all the 
  iptables commands required to implement the user defined security policy. 
  This script file can also include information required to configure 
  interfaces, static routes and other configuration options.
  </para>

  <para>
  Once the firewall script file has been created Firewall Builder can use 
  the secure SSH and SCP protocols to transfer the script file to the 
  Linux firewall server and to activate it, or user's can copy the
  the script file themselves to the server and run it to activate the 
  firewall rules.
