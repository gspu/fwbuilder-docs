    <title>Configuring iptables Policy Rules</title>

    <para>
    After you have created a firewall object and network objects you can start 
    to configure the firewall's rules.  When you create a firewall object, 
    for example <emphasis>linux-1</emphasis> from our previous example, it 
    will be opened automatically in the object tree and its Policy object 
    is opened in the main window for editing. The Policy object is where 
    access list rules are configured.
    </para>

    <para>
    To add a new rule to the Policy, click on the green
    <imagedata fileref="images/green_plus.png" /> icon at the top
    left of the main window. This creates a new rule with default values set
    to deny all.
    </para>

  </figure> 

    <para>
    Every rule includes the following sections:
    </para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem role="cisco_getting_started"><para><emphasis>Source</emphasis> - 
      this can be one or more IP objects. Default value is Any which is the 
      same as the "0/0" iptables parameter that matches all IP addresses.
      </para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><emphasis>Destination</emphasis> - this can be one or 
      more IP objects. Default value is Any which is the same as the "0/0" 
      parameter in iptables that matches all IP addresses.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><emphasis>Service</emphasis> - this can be one or more 
      Service object. Example services include the TCP and UDP protocols like 
      HTTP and DNS. Default value is Any which matches any IP service.
      </para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><emphasis>Interface</emphasis> - this can be one or 
      more interfaces configured on the firewall object. Default 
      value is All which means the rule will be applied to all interfaces.
      </para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><emphasis>Direction</emphasis> - options are Inbound, 
      Outbound and Both. This roughly translates to the iptables INPUT, 
      OUTPUT and FORWARD chains. Default value is Both.</para></listitem>
      <listitem><para><emphasis>Action</emphasis> - Options are:
        <itemizedlist role="getting_started_sublist">

    <bridgehead>Configuring a Rule</bridgehead>

    <para>
    In the examples below the fields in the rule will be set to the values that 
    match the first rule from our example scenario (scenario rules shown in 
    figure below). This rule controls SSH access to the firewall itself.
    </para>  
     
  <figure id="iptables_scenario_rules">

    <graphic scale="50" fileref="images/iptables_scenario_rules.png" />
  </figure> 

    <bridgehead>Setting the Source</bridgehead>

    <para>
    To set the Source of a rule, drag-and-drop at least one IP object from the
    tree to the Source field of your rule. For example, drag the Network  
    object called Internal Network that you created earlier to the Source column 
    of the rule as shown below.
    </para>

    <title>Setting the Source</title>      
    <graphic scale="50" fileref="images/new_rule_source.png" />
  </figure> 

    <para>
    After you drop the network object into the rule the Source fields will
    change from Any to Internal Network.
    </para>

  <figure id="iptables_rule_step1">
    <title>After Source is Set</title>      
    <graphic scale="50" fileref="images/rule_step1.png" />
  </figure> 

  <note>
    <para>
    You can have more than one IP object in the Source and Destination fields. 
    When Firewall Builder generates the iptables commands it will 
    automatically split the rule in to multiple lines if necessary.
    </para>
  </note>

    <bridgehead>Setting the Destination</bridgehead>

    <para>
    Setting the Destination is exactly the same as setting the Source, except
    you drag-and-drop IP objects in to the Destination field of the rule. For 
    our first example rule we want the Destination to be the "inside" interface 
    of the firewall object. Drag-and-drop the eth1 object from the object 
    tree to the Destination column.
    </para>

    <title>Setting the Destination</title>      
    <graphic scale="50" fileref="images/iptables_new_rule_destination.png" />
  </figure> 

    <para>
    After you drop the interface object into the rule the Destination field will
    change from Any to "inside" which is the label of the eth1 interface.
    </para>

    <title>After Destination is Set</title>      
    <graphic scale="50" fileref="images/rule_step2.png" />
  </figure> 

    <bridgehead>Setting the Service</bridgehead>

    <para>
    Firewall Builder comes with hundreds of <emphasis>predefined</emphasis> 
    objects including Service objects for almost all standard protocols. 
    To access these objects switch to the Standard library by selecting it 
    from the drop down at the top of the Object tree window.
    </para>

  <figure id="iptables_switch_library">
    <title>Switching Libraries</title>      
    <graphic scale="50" fileref="images/switch_library.png" />
  </figure> 

    <para>
    Services are located in the <emphasis>Services</emphasis> folder. 
    In this rule we want to set the service to SSH, so you would navigate 
    to the SSH service by opening the Services folder, then opening the 
    <emphasis>TCP</emphasis> folder and scrolling down until you find the 
    "ssh" object.
    </para>

    <para>
    Once you find the ssh object, drag-and-drop from the tree on the left in
    to the Service section of the rule in the Rules window.
    </para>

    <title>Setting the Service</title>      
    <graphic scale="50" fileref="images/rule_step3.png" />
  </figure> 

  <note>
    <para>
    To switch back to the User library, which contains the objects that you 
    created, click on the drop down menu that says Standard and select User 
    from the list of libraries.
    </para>
  </note>

    <bridgehead>Setting the Interface</bridgehead>

    <para>
    If desired, set the Interface for the rule by dragging-and-dropping 
    an interface object from the firewall object to the Interface 
    section of the rule. This, combined with the Direction setting, will 
    cause the generated iptables rules to include -i &lt;interface&gt; or 
    -o &lt;interface&gt;.
    </para>
        
  <figure id="iptables_new_rule_interface">
    <title>Setting the Interface</title>      
    <graphic scale="50" fileref="images/iptables_new_rule_interface.png" />
  </figure> 

    <bridgehead>Setting the Direction</bridgehead>

    <para>
    The direction of the rule is based on the traffic you want to filter.

    Traffic coming in to an interface should have the rule Direction set
    to Inbound and traffic going out of an interface should have the rule
    Direction set to Outbound. In our example the direction of the rule 
    will be Inbound since it is controlling access to the firewall itself 
    on the "inside" interface.
    </para>

    <bridgehead>Setting the Action</bridgehead>

    <para>
    The action controls whether traffic matching the rule should be permitted
    or denied. Firewall Builder sets the default action for INPUT, OUTPUT and 
    FORWARD chains to deny, so any traffic that has not matched a rule that 
    permits the traffic will be dropped. Right-click and set the action to 
    "Accept" to allow the SSH traffic from the local network to the firewall.
    </para>

    <bridgehead>Setting the Options</bridgehead>

    <para>
    Logging for rule matches is set in the Options section. By default logging
    is turned on. To turn logging off, right-click in the Options section and
    select Logging Off.
    </para>

    <bridgehead>Example of a Complete Rule</bridgehead>

    <para>
    The following is the first rule from our example which allows traffic from
    the internal network to the firewall's inside interface that has a traffic 
    type of SSH. 
    </para>

    <bridgehead>Adding a Rule</bridgehead>

    <para>
    To add a new rule click the
    <imagedata fileref="images/green_plus.png" /> icon at the
    top of the Rules Editor window.  This will insert a new rule above
    the current rule. To add a new rule below the current rule right-click
    on a rule and select "Add New Rule Below".

  </figure> 
        
    <bridgehead>Copy-and-Paste</bridgehead>

    <para>
    In addition to drag-and-drop you can also copy-and-paste objects.
    For example, you can right-click on the Internal Network object in
    the first rule and select Copy. Navigate to the Source section of
    the new rule you just created and right-click and select Paste.
    </para>

    <bridgehead>Using Filters to Find Objects</bridgehead>

    <para>
    Filters provide a way to quickly find objects in the tree without
    having to open multiple folders and scroll. For example, if you wanted
    to use the POP3 protocol in a rule you could use the filter to find it.
    </para>

    <para>
    The POP3 protocol object is located in the Standard library, so select it
    from the dropdown menu at the top of the Object Window. Type pop3 in to
    the filter field. This will display all objects in the current library
    that contain pop3.
    </para>

  <figure id="iptables_pop3_filter">
    <title>Using Filter to Find Objects</title>      
    <graphic scale="50" fileref="images/pop3_filter.png" />
  </figure> 
        
  <note>
    <para>
    After you are done with the filtered object, clear the
    filter field by clicking the X to the right of the input box and then
    switch back to the User library by selecting it in the dropdown menu
    at the top of the object panel.
    </para>

    <bridgehead>Example of Completed Rules</bridgehead>

    <para>
    For our example we needed to create two firewall rules for traffic 
    going through or to the firewall. We also create a special rule at 
    the top of the Policy that allows the firewall to communicate with 
    itself using the loopback interface. The completed firewalll rules 
    are shown in the diagram below.
    </para>

  <figure id="iptables_three_rules">
    <title>Three Rules</title>      
    <graphic scale="50" fileref="images/iptables_three_rules.png" />
  </figure> 

  <note>
  <para>
    Many Linux processes use the loopback interface to communicate between 
    processes, so it is very important to have a rule at the top of the 
    policy that allows the firewall to communicate with itself using the 
    loopback interface.
