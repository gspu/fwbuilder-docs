  <title>Firewall Builder GUI Layout</title>
  <para>
  Before we get started configuring our example firewall, let&apos;s take 
  a minute to orient ourselves with the Firewall Builder application. The 
  GUI is comprised of three primary panels, shown in the screenshot below.

      <para>
      <emphasis>Object Panel</emphasis>. Objects in the active 
      Library are displayed in an object tree in the Object Panel. Empty 
      folders are defined for all possible object types that a user can 
      create in the User library.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
      <emphasis>Rules Panel</emphasis>. When a Policy object is 
      opened for editing it is displayed in the Rules Panel. Clicking on 
      the green <imagedata fileref="images/green_plus.png"/> 
    icon at the top of the panel creates a new rule.
      </para>
    </listitem>
    <listitem>
      <para>
      <emphasis>Editor Panel</emphasis>. Double-clicking on 
      objects opens them for editing in the Editor Panel. Changes to object 
      attribute fields take effect immediately.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  <para>
  Panels open dynamically based on what activity the user is performing. 
  For example, double-clicking an object to edit it will open the Editor
  Panel if it is not already open. </para>

  <para>Now we are ready to get started
