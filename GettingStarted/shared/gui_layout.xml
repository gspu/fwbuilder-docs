      <listitem><emphasis>Object Panel</emphasis>. Objects in the active Library are displayed
        in an object tree in the Object Panel. Empty folders are defined 
        for all possible object types that a user can create in the User library.

      <listitem><emphasis>Rules Panel</emphasis>. When a Policy object is opened for editing
        it is displayed in the Rules Panel.  Clicking on the '+' button
        at the top of the panel creates a new rule.</listitem>
      <listitem><emphasis>Editor Panel</emphasis>. Double-clicking on objects opens them for
        editing in the Editor Panel.  Changes to object attribute fields 
        take effect immediately.</listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

  <para>
  Panels open dynamically based on what activity the user is performing. 
  For example, double-clicking an object to edit it will open the Editor
  Panel if it is not already open.
