  <title>Configuring NAT Rules</title>
  <para>
    Now that the basic firewall rules are configured we need 
    to define our NAT policy. Open the NAT object for editing by 
    double-clicking on it in the object tree as shown in the diagram 
    below.

    For this example we will create a single NAT rule that  
    translates the source IP address of any traffic coming from 
    the inside 10.10.10.0/24 network going to the Internet. The 
    source IP should be translated to the IP address of the &quot;outside&quot; 
    interface of the firewall.
    </para>
  <para>
    To edit NAT rules we use the same concepts  used 
    to edit the firewall Policy rules. Start by clicking the green 
     <imagedata fileref="images/green_plus.png"/> icon at the top 
    of the Rules panel to add a new NAT rule.
    </para>
  <para>
    Drag-and-drop the &quot;Internal Network&quot; object you created earlier 
    to the Original Src column of the NAT rule. This identifies the 
    traffic that will have its source IP address translated. Now, 
    drag-and-drop the &quot;outside&quot; interface from the asa-1 firewall 
    object to the Translated Src column of the rule. This field 
    identifies the IP address that the traffic will be translated 
    to. After you are done the NAT rule should like the diagram below.
    </para>

  <para>
    That&apos;s it!  Now we are ready to generate the configuration file 
    and use the built-in installer to deploy it to the firewall.
