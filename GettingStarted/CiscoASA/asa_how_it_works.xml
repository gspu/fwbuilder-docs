  <title>How Firewall Builder works with Cisco ASA Firewalls</title>
  <para>
  Conceptually Firewall Builder works the same way no matter what type of 
  firewall is being configured. Firewall Builder is based on the idea of 
  using objects to represent rule elements, such as IP networks and  Host 
  addresses, and then using these objects to define firewall rules.
  </para>
  <para>
  For Cisco ASA and Cisco PIX firewalls, after the firewall object rules  creation Firewall Builder  generates a configuration file  
  containing all the Cisco CLI commands required to implement the  
  defined security policy. This configuration file  includes optional 
  information required to configure interfaces, static routes, and 
  other configuration options as needed.
  </para>
  <para>
  Once the configuration file has been created, Firewall Builder can use 
  the secure SSH and SCP protocols to transfer the configuration to the 
  Cisco ASA or PIX firewall and  activate the generated configuration, 
  or users can manually copy-and-paste the generated configuration file 
  into a command line session.
