  <title>How Firewall Builder works with Cisco ASA Firewalls</title>

  <para>
  Conceptually Firewall Builder works the same way no matter what type of 
  firewall is being configured. Firewall Builder is based on the idea of 
  using objects to represent rule elements, such as IP networks Host 
  addresses, and then using these objects to define firewalll rules.
  </para>

  <para>
  For Cisco ASA and Cisco PIX firewalls after the firewall rules have 
  been created Firewall Builder will generate a configuration file that 
  contains all the Cisco CLI commands required to implement the user 
  defined security policy. This configuration file can also include 
  information required to configure interfaces, static routes and 
  other configuration options.
  </para>

  <para>
  Once the configuration file has been created Firewall Builder can use 
  the secure SSH and SCP protocols to transfer the configuration to the 
  Cisco ASA or PIX firewall and to activate the generated configuration, 
  or user's can manually copy-and-paste the generated configuration file 
  onto a command line session.
