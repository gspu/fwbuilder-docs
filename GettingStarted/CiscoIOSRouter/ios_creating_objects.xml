  <title>Creating Objects</title>

  <para>
  Firewall Builder is based on the concept of objects. There are
  a variety of different object types that can be used to define
  IP objects that can be used as the Source and Destination in
  your router ACL rules. Two of the most common IP objects used
  in Cisco access lists are <emphasis>Networks</emphasis> and 
  <emphasis>Addresses</emphasis>.
  </para>

  <bridgehead>Network Objects</bridgehead>

  <para>
  To create a Network object, for example a network to represent the
  internal 10.0.0.0/24 network in the diagram above, go to the object
  tree on the left side of the screen and double-click the folder
  labeled <emphasis>Objects</emphasis> to expand it. Right click on the folder called
  <emphasis>Networks</emphasis> and select “New Network”. This creates a new network
  object. In the lower portion of your screen, called the Editor
  Panel, you can modify the properties of this object.
  </para>

  <para>
  Change the object name to something that matches the function, in this
  example we are going to call it “Internal Network” to represent the
  network connected to our "inside" interface. The address is set to 10.0.0.0
  and the netmask is 255.255.255.0.

  <note>
  <para>
  When editing the attributes of an object there is no Apply
  or Submit button. Once you edit an attribute as soon as you move away from
  the field you were editing the change will take effect immediately.
  </para>
  </note>

  <bridgehead>Address Objects</bridgehead>

  <para>
  To create an object that represents a single IP address, similar to the
  host parameter in a Cisco access list, go to the object tree and
  right-click on the <emphasis>Addresses</emphasis> folder and select "New Address". In the
  Editor Panel change the name of the object to something that reflects its
  function, for example “POP3 Server”, and set the IP address.
