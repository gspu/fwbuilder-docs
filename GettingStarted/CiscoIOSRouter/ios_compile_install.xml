  <para>
  In Firewall Builder the process of converting the rules from the
  Firewall Builder GUI syntax to the target device commands is called
  <emphasis>compiling</emphasis> the configuration.
  </para>

  <para>
  To compile, click on the Compile icon which looks like a hammer
  <imagedata fileref="images/hammer_small.png" />. If you
  haven’t saved your configuration file yet you will be asked to do so. After
  you save your file a wizard will be displayed that lets you select which
  firewall(s) you want to compile. In this example we are going to complie
  the firewall called <emphasis>router-1</emphasis> configured with the rules above.
  </para>

  <para>
  If there aren’t any errors, you should see some messages scroll by in the
  main window and a message at the top left stating Success.
  </para>

  <para>
  To view the output of the compile, click on the button that says Inspect
  Generated Files.  This will open the file that contains the commands in
  Cisco command format.  Note that any line that starts with “!” is a comment.
  </para>

  <para>
  The output from the compiler is automatically saved in a file in the same
  directory as the data file that was used to create it. The generated files
  are named with the firewall name and a .fw extension. In our example the
  generated configuration file is called router-1.fw. You can copy and copy and
  paste the commands from this file to your router or you can use the built-in
  Firewall Builder installer.
  </para>

  <bridgehead>Installing</bridgehead>

  <para>
  Firewall Builder can install the generated configuration file for you
  using SSH.  To use the installer we need to identify one of the router
  interfaces as the “Management Interface”.  This tells Firewall Builder
  which IP address to connect to on the router.
  </para>

  <para>
  Do this by double-clicking the firewall object to expand it, and then
  double-clicking on the interface name that you want to assign as the
  management interface.  In our case this is interface FastEthernet0/1
  which is the interface connected to the internal network.

<note>
  <para>
  Any time you are changing access lists on your router
  you face the risk of locking yourself out of the device.  Please be
  careful to always inspect your access lists closely and make sure that
  you will be able to access the router after the access list is installed.
  </para>
</note>

  <para>
  To install your access lists on the router, click on the install icon
  <imagedata fileref="images/install_icon.png" />. This will
  bring up a wizard where you will select the firewall to install. Click
  Next > to install the selected firewall.
  </para>

  <para>
  Firewall Builder will compile your rules converting them in to
  Cisco access list command line format. After the compile completes
  successfully click Next >. Enter your username, password and enable
  password.

  <para>
  After the access list configuration is installed you see a message
  at the bottom of the main window and the status indicator in the
  upper left corner of the wizard will indicate if the installation
  was successful.
  </para>

  <para>
  By default Firewall Builder will connect to your router using SSH and
  send the commands line-by-line to the router. Depending on the size of
  your access lists this can be slow.
  </para>

  <para>
  If your router is running IOS version 12.4 you can select an option to
  have Firewall Builder scp the generated configuration file to the router
  instead of applying it line-by-line. This is much faster and is recommended
  if your router supports it.
  </para>

  <para>
  This requires ssh version 2 to be enabled on the router and scp server
  to be enabled. You can find complete instructions for enabling SCP
  installation in our
