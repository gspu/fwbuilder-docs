  <title>How Firewall Builder works with Cisco IOS Router Access Lists</title>

  <para>
  Conceptually Firewall Builder works the same way no matter what type of 
  firewall is being configured. Firewall Builder is based on the idea of 
  using objects to represent rule elements, such as IP networks Host 
  addresses, and then using these objects to define firewalll rules.
  </para>

  <para>
  When a Cisco IOS Router is configured as a firewall in Firewall Builder 
  after the firewall rules have been created for that device Firewall 
  Builder will generate a configuration file that contains all the Cisco 
  CLI commands required to implement the user defined security policy. This 
  configuration file can also include information required to configure 
  interfaces, static routes and other configuration options.
  </para>

  <para>
  Once the configuration file has been created Firewall Builder can use 
  the secure SSH and SCP protocols to transfer the configuration to the 
  Cisco IOS Router firewall and to activate the generated configuration, 
  or user's can manually copy-and-paste the generated configuration file 
  onto a command line session.

  <note>
  <para>
  <imagedata scale="50" fileref="images/warning.png" /> Firewall Builder 
  supports creating access lists and static routes for Cisco IOS Routers. 
  Configuration of NAT rules is <emphasis>not</emphasis> supported at 
  this time.
