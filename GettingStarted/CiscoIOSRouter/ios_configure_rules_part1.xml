  <para>
  To add a new rule to the Policy, click on the green
  <imagedata fileref="images/green_plus.png" /> icon at the top
  left of the main window. This creates a new rule with default values set
  to deny all.
  </para>

  <graphic scale="50" fileref="images/default_rule.png" />
</figure> 

  <para>
  Every rule includes the following sections:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem role="cisco_getting_started"><para><emphasis>Source</emphasis> - 
    this can be one or more IP 
    objects. Default value is Any which is the same as the "any" parameter 
    in a Cisco access list that matches all IP addresses.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para><emphasis>Destination</emphasis> - this can be one or 
    more IP objects. Default value is Any which is the same as the "any" 
    parameter in a Cisco access list that matches all IP addresses.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para><emphasis>Service</emphasis> - this can be one or more 
    Service object. Example services include the TCP and UDP protocols like 
    HTTP and DNS. Default value is Any which matches any IP service and is 
    the same as the "ip" parameter in Cisco access lists.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para><emphasis>Interface</emphasis> - this can be one or 
    more interfaces configured on the firewall (router) object. Default 
    value is All which means the rule will be applied as an access list to 
    all configured interfaces.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para><emphasis>Direction</emphasis> - options are Inbound, 
    Outbound and Both. This defines whether the resulting access-group will 
    be applied to interfaces as "in" or "out". Both will generate an identical 
    rule for "in" and "out". Default value is Both.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para><emphasis>Action</emphasis> - options are Accept and Deny. 
    This matches the Cisco access list parameters "permit" and "deny". Default 
    value is Deny.</para></listitem>
    <listitem><para><emphasis>Options</emphasis> - options are Logging On and 
    Logging Off. Setting Logging On matches the Cisco access list parameter 
    "log".  Default value is Logging On.</para></listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <bridgehead>Setting the Source</bridgehead>

  <para>
  To set the Source of a rule, drag-and-drop at least one IP object from the
  tree to the Source section of your rule. For example, if you created a
  Network object called Internal Network you would drag this to your rule
  as shown below.
  </para>

<figure id="gs_acl_new_rule_source">
  <title>Setting the Source</title>      
  <graphic scale="50" fileref="images/new_rule_source.png" />
</figure> 

  <para>
  After you drop the network object into the rule the Source section will
  change from Any to Internal Network.
  </para>

<figure id="gs_acl_rule_step1">
  <title>After Source is Set</title>      
  <graphic scale="50" fileref="images/rule_step1.png" />
</figure> 

<note>
  <para>
  You can have more than one IP object in the Source and
  Destination sections. When Firewall Builder generates the Cisco command
  line access lists it will automatically split the rule in to multiple
  lines if necessary.
  </para>
</note>

  <bridgehead>Setting the Destination</bridgehead>

  <para>
  Setting the Destination is exactly the same as setting the Source, except
  you drag-and-drop IP objects in to the Destination section of the rule.
  </para>

  <bridgehead>Setting the Service</bridgehead>

  <para>
  Firewall Builder comes with hundreds of <emphasis>predefined</emphasis> objects including
  Service objects for almost all standard protocols. To access these objects
  switch to the Standard library by selecting it from the drop down at the
  top of the Object tree window.
  </para>

<figure id="gs_acl_switch_library">
  <title>Switching Libraries</title>      
  <graphic scale="50" fileref="images/switch_library.png" />
</figure> 

  <para>
  Services are located in the <emphasis>Services</emphasis> folder. For example, if you wanted
  to define a rule that permitted HTTP traffic you would navigate to
  the HTTP service by opening the Services folder, then opening the <emphasis>TCP</emphasis>
  folder and scrolling down until you find the http object.
  </para>

  <para>
  Once you find the http object, drag-and-drop from the tree on the left in
  to the Service section of the rule in the Rules window.
  </para>
      
<figure id="gs_acl_new_rule_service">
  <title>Setting the Service</title>      
  <graphic scale="50" fileref="images/new_rule_service.png" />
</figure> 

<note>
  <para>
  To switch back to the User library, which contains the
  objects that you created, click on the drop down menu that says Standard
  and select User from the list of libraries.
  </para>
</note>

  <bridgehead>Setting the Interface</bridgehead>

  <para>
  Set the Interface for the rule by dragging-and-dropping an interface
  object from the firewall (router) object to the Interface section of
  the rule. This will define which interface on the router that the
  access list will be applied to as an "access-group".
  </para>
      
<figure id="gs_acl_new_rule_interface">
  <title>Setting the Interface</title>      
  <graphic scale="50" fileref="images/new_rule_interface.png" />
</figure> 

  <bridgehead>Setting the Direction</bridgehead>

  <para>
  The direction of the rule is based on the traffic you want to filter.
  Traffic coming in to an interface should have the rule Direction set
  to Inbound and traffic going out of an interface should have the rule
  Direction set to Outbound.
  </para>

  <para>
  The Direction combined with the Interface setting will determine which
  interfaces should have this rule applied.
  </para>

<note>
  <para>
  Setting the Direction to Both will create 2 access lists
  per rule, one that will be applied as an access-group "in" and one that
  will be applied as an access-group "out".
  </para>
</note>

  <bridgehead>Setting the Action</bridgehead>

  <para>
  The action controls whether traffic matching the rule should be permitted
  or denied. Remember, all Cisco access lists have an implicit deny at the
  end of the list, so any traffic that has not matched a rule that permits
  the traffic will be dropped.
  </para>

  <bridgehead>Setting the Options</bridgehead>

  <para>
  Logging for rule matches is set in the Options section. By default logging
  is turned on. To turn logging off, right-click in the Options section and
  select Logging Off.
  </para>

  <bridgehead>Example of a Complete Rule</bridgehead>

  <para>
  The following is an example of a complete rule that allows traffic from
  an internal network to any destination address arriving inbound on the
  "inside" interface for the HTTP and HTTPS protocols.
  </para>

  <bridgehead>Additional Tips</bridgehead>

  <bridgehead>Adding a Rule</bridgehead>

  <para>
  To add a new rule click the
  <imagedata fileref="images/green_plus.png" /> icon at the
  top of the Rules Editor window.  This will insert a new rule above
  the current rule. To add a new rule below the current rule right-click
  on a rule and select "Add New Rule Below".
  </para>

<figure id="gs_acl_add_new_rule_below">
  <title>Adding Rules</title>      
  <graphic scale="50" fileref="images/add_new_rule_below.png" />
</figure> 
      
  <bridgehead>Copy-and-Paste</bridgehead>

  <para>
  In addition to drag-and-drop you can also copy-and-paste objects.
  For example, you can right-click on the Internal Network object in
  the first rule and select Copy. Navigate to the Source section of
  the new rule you just created and right-click and select Paste.
  </para>

  <bridgehead>Using Filters to Find Objects</bridgehead>

  <para>
  Filters provide a way to quickly find objects in the tree without
  having to open multiple folders and scroll. For example, if you wanted
  to use the POP3 protocol in a rule you could use the filter to find it.
  </para>

  <para>
  The POP3 protocol object is located in the Standard library, so select it
  from the dropdown menu at the top of the Object Window. Type pop3 in to
  the filter field. This will display all objects in the current library
  that contain pop3.
  </para>

<figure id="gs_acl_pop3_filter">
  <title>Using Filter to Find Objects</title>      
  <graphic scale="50" fileref="images/pop3_filter.png" />
</figure> 
      
<note>
  <para>
  After you are done with the filtered object, clear the
  filter field by clicking the X to the right of the input box and then
  switch back to the User library by selecting it in the dropdown menu
  at the top of the object panel.
  </para>
</note>

  <para>
  For the following sections we are going to assume that the following
  three rules defined for the router configuration shown in Section 4.2.1.
