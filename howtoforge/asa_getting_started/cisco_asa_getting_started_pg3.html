            <h2>Getting Started: Configuring Cisco ASA & PIX</h2>

            <p>
            <b>Reminder</b> - In this tutorial we are configuring a Cisco
            ASA 5505 firewall that has the following interface configuration.

            <h2>Step 4: Configure NAT Rules</h2>

            <p>
            Now that we have configured the Access Lists, the next step is to 
            configure the NAT rules. Here are the NAT rules that we need to 
            create:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
              Source NAT all inside traffic (10.0.0.0/24) through the firewall
              destined to any Internet address changing the source IP to the IP
              address of the outside interface (Ethernet0/0).
              </li>
              <li>
              Destination NAT traffic from external IP address (198.51.100.25),
              the external SMTP relay server, coming to the outside interface with
              TCP destination port of 25 (SMTP) and forward that to an internal
              Email Server (10.0.0.25).
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            To open the NAT rules for editing, double-click on the &#34;NAT&#34; 
            object located under the asa-1 firewall object in the tree. To add a 
            new rule to the Policy, click on the green <img src="green_plus.png" /> 
            icon at the top left of the main window.
            </p>

            <center>
            <img src="asa_nat_rule.png" />
            </center>

            <p>
            To create the first NAT rule, drag-and-drop the Internal Network object 
            from the tree to the Original Src column of the NAT rule. Next, 
            drag-and-drop the firewall object's outside interface (Ethernet0/0) to
            the Translated Src column of the rule.
            <p> 

            <p>
            That's it. You should now have a NAT rule that looks like:
            </p>

            <center>
            <img src="asa_nat_rule_one.png" />
            </center>

            <p>
            Right-click on the NAT rule you just created and select Add New Rule 
            Below. The next NAT rule should translate traffic coming from the 
            external SMTP Relay server to the internal Email Server. Follow the 
            steps below to create the NAT rule.
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
              Drag-and-drop the SMTP Relay object from the object tree to the 
              Original Src column of the new NAT rule.
              </li>
              <li>
              Drag-and-drop the Ethernet0/0 interface object from the asa-1 
              firewall object to the Original Src of the rule.
              </li>
              <li>
              Switch to the Standard library and filter for the smtmp object. 
              Drag-and-drop it to the Service column of the rule.
              </li>
              <li>
              Clear the filter and switch back to the User library and drag-and-
              drop the Email Server object from the object tree to the Translated 
              Dst column of the rule.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
            You should now have two NAT rules that look like:
            </p>

            <center>
            <img src="asa_nat_two_rules.png" />
            </center>

            <p>
            In the next section we will go through the process of compiling and 
            installing the Access List and NAT rules on the firewall.
