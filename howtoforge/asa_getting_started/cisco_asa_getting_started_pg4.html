        <h2>Getting Started: Configuring Cisco ASA & PIX</h2>

        <p>
        For the following sections we are going to assume that the following
        Policy rules have been configured for the firewall configuration shown 
        in the diagram above.
        </p>

        </center>

        <p>
        And that the following two NAT rules have been configured for the firewall 
        shown in the diagram above.
        </p>

        </center>


        <h2>Step 4: Compile and Install</h2>

        <p>
        In Firewall Builder the process of converting the rules from the
        Firewall Builder GUI syntax to the target device commands is called 
        <b>compiling</b> the configuration.
        </p>
        
        <p>
        To compile, click on the Compile icon which looks like a hammer 
        <img src="hammer_small.png" />.  If you 
        haven&#39;t saved your configuration file yet you will be asked to do so. After 
        you save your file a wizard will be displayed that lets you select which 
        firewall(s) you want to compile. In this example we are going to complie
        the firewall called <b>asa-1</b> configured with the rules above. 
        </p>

        <p>
        If there aren&#39;t any errors, you should see some messages scroll by in the 
        main window and a message at the top left stating Success.
        </p>

        <p>
        To view the output of the compile, click on the button that says Inspect 
        Generated Files. This will open the file that contains the commands in 
        Cisco command format. Note that any line that starts with &#34;&#33;&#34; 
        is a comment.
        </p>

        <center>
        <img src="asa_compiler_output2.png" />
        </center>

        <p>
        The output from the compiler is automatically saved in a file in the same 
        directory as the data file that was used to create it. The generated files 
        are named with the firewall name and a .fw extension. In our example the 
        generated configuration file is called asa-1.fw. You can copy and copy and 
        paste the commands from this file to your firewall or you can use the built-in 
        Firewall Builder installer.
        </p>

        <h4>Installing</h4>

        <p>
        Firewall Builder can install the generated configuration file for you 
        using SSH.  To use the installer we need to identify one of the firewall 
        interfaces as the &#34;Management Interface&#34;.  This tells Firewall Builder 
        which IP address to use to connect to the firewall.
        </p>

        <p>
        Do this by double-clicking the firewall object to expand it, and then 
        double-clicking on the interface name that you want to assign as the 
        management interface.  In our case this is interface Ethernet0/1 
        which is the interface connected to the internal network.
        </p>

        </center>

        <p>
        <b>CAUTION!</b> Any time you are changing access lists on your firewall 
        you face the risk of locking yourself out of the device.  Please be 
        careful to always inspect your access lists closely and make sure that 
        you will be able to access the firewall after the access list is installed.
        </p>

        <p>
        To install your access lists on the firewall, click on the install icon
        <img src="install_icon.png" />. This will
        bring up a wizard where you will select the firewall to install. Click
        Next > to install the selected firewall.
        </p>

        <center>
        <img src="asa_install_checkbox.png" />
        </center>

        <p>
        Firewall Builder will compile your rules converting them in to
        Cisco access list command line format. After the compile completes 
        successfully click Next >. Enter your username, password and enable 
        password.
        </p>

        <center>
        <img src="install_screen.png" />
        </center>

        <p>
        After the access list configuration is installed you see a message
        at the bottom of the main window and the status indicator in the 
        upper left corner of the wizard will indicate if the installation
        was successful.
        </p>

        <center>
        <img src="asa_install_success.png" />
        </center>
        
        <p>
        By default Firewall Builder will use SCP to copy the generated config 
        file to the firewall. Once the file is copied to the firewall, Firewall 
        Builder will connect using SSH to load the transferred config file from 
        memory using the "copy" command to merge the Firewall Builder generated 
        command with the current running configuration.
        </p>

        <p>
        Firewall Builder requires ssh version 2 to be enabled on the firewall.
        </p>
