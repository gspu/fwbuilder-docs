  <h1>Handling of Broadcast and Multicast Addresses</h1>

  <p></p>

  <p>
    Some firewall platforms require Firewall Builder to recognize and
    treat boradcast and multicast addresses in a special way. In
    particular, iptables processes packets with broadcast and
    multicast destination addresses in the <b>INPUT</b> chain and
    Firewall Builder policy compilers should take this into account
    while generating iptables script.
  </p>

  <h2>Boradcast and Multicast Addresses, iptables Firewall</h2>

  <p></p>

  <p>
    In order to match broadcast or multicast addresses in the rules,
    we need to create objects to describe them. The choice of object
    type to describe broadcast or multicast address depends on whether
    this is just a single address, a range or a block. Address object
    is good to define single address, Address Range is good for sets
    of consequtive addresses, and Network object is good to describe a
    block. For example, one can use Address object with address
    "255.255.255.255" to describe a broadcast.  Address Range with
    addresses "224.0.0.5 - 224.0.0.6" would work well to describe two
    multicast groups used by OSPF. Network object with address
    "224.0.0.0" and netmask "240.0.0.0" can be used to describe whole
    multicast address block.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here are few examples:
  </p>


  <img src="multicast_object_1.png"/>

  <p>
    Object <b>"all multicasts"</b> is part of
    the <b>Standard Objects</b> library that comes with
    the program and describes entire address block
    allocated for multicasts. Consider simple policy
    rule that permits all multicasts:
  </p>

  <img src="multicast_rule_1.png"/>

  <p>
    For iptables, this rule translates into the following
    script:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <p class="command">
      $IPTABLES -A INPUT  -d 224.0.0.0/4  -m state --state NEW  -j ACCEPT 
    </p>
  </p>

  <p>
    The rule went into the <b>INPUT</b> chain because
    iptables processes multicast in it.
  </p>

  <p>
    Here is another example, this time it involves
    broadcast addresses. Interface <b>inside</b> of the
    test firewall has address 172.16.22.1 with netmask
    255.255.255.0. This defines subnet
    172.16.22.0/255.255.255.0 with broadcast address
    172.16.22.255. We create Address object with the name
    "net-172.16.22 broadcast" and address "172.16.22.255"
    and use it in the destination field of a policy rule.
    Another rule in the same example will match broadcast
    address "255.255.255.255"; an Address Range Object
    that defines this address is present in the Standard
    Objects library under the name "broadcast". Here are
    the rules:
  </p>
  
  <img src="broadcast_rules_1.png"/>

  <p>
    these two rules translate into the following script
    for iptables:
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <p class="command">
      # Rule 0 (global)<br>
      # <br>
      $IPTABLES -A INPUT  -d 255.255.255.255  -m state --state NEW  -j ACCEPT <br>
      # <br>
      # Rule 1 (global)<br>
      # <br>
      $IPTABLES -A INPUT  -d 172.16.22.255  -m state --state NEW  -j ACCEPT <br>
    </p>
  </p>

  <p>
    Both rules went into INPUT chain as expected.
  </p>



  <h2>Boradcast and Multicast Addresses and Bridging iptables Firewall</h2>

  <p></p>

  <p>
    Compilers treat broadcast and multicast addresses
    differently if the firewall object describes bridging
    firewall. In this case checkbox <b>"Bridging
      firewall"</b> should be turned on in the firewall
    settings dialog and one or more interface objects
    should be marked as <b>"Bridge port"</b>:
  </p>

  <img src="bridge_interface_dialog_1.png"/>

  <p>
    Now the rule that should match broadcast destination
    address will be treated differently:
  </p>

  <img src="broadcast_rules_2.png"/>

  <p>
    this produces the following iptables commands:

    <p class="command">
      $IPTABLES -A FORWARD  -d 172.16.22.255  -m state --state NEW  -j ACCEPT <br>
      $IPTABLES -A INPUT  -d 172.16.22.255  -m state --state NEW  -j ACCEPT <br>
    </p>
  </p>

  <p>
    Rules went into both <b>INPUT</b> and <b>FORWARD</b>
    chains because bridging firewall passes broadcasts
    through, but at the same time accepts them as packets
    headed for itself as well. Since the rule did not
    specify which interface it should look at, fwbuilder
    assumed that generated rule should inspect packets
    crossing all interfaces, both bridge ports and
    "normal" ones and therefore placed rule in
    both <b>INPUT</b> and <b>FORWARD</b> chains.
