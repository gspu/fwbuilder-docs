    This guide presents an introduction to Firewall
      Builder. <b>Firewall Builder</b> (also known
      as <b>fwbuilder</b>) is a GUI firewall configuration and
      management tool that supports <b>iptables (netfilter), ipfilter,
      pf, ipfw, Cisco PIX (FWSM, ASA) and Cisco routers extended
      access lists</b>. Both professional network administrators and
      hobbyists managing firewalls with policies more complex that is
      allowed by simple web based UI can simplify management tasks
      with the application. The program runs on Linux, FreeBSD,
      OpenBSD, Windows and Mac OS X and can manage both local and
      remote firewalls.
  </p>

  <p>
    Firewall Builder is packaged with most Linux distributions. If the
    package is not available in the base distribution, it usually can
    be found in "extras". You need to install package that has
    supporting API library <b>libfwbuilder</b> and
    package <b>fwbuilder</b> that contains Firewall Builder GUI and
    policy compilers. You can use your favorite package management
    tool sucn as <b>yum</b> or <b>aptotude</b> to find and install
    them. On FreeBSD and OpenBSD Firewall Builder is part of ports,
    you can find it in <b>/usr/ports/security/fwbuilder</b>.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the OS you are using does not come with pre-built binary
    fwbuilder package, you can always build it yourself using our
    online <a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/guides/firewall_builder_installation.html">installation
    instructions</a>. Pre-built binary packages and source code tar.gz
    archives can be downloaded
    from <a href="http://www.fwbuilder.org/docs/firewall_builder_packages.html">from
    this page</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    OS that ship fwbuilder package usually include system menu item
    that makes it easy to start the program. However if the menu item
    is not there or you have built the program from source, you can
    always launch it from the command line by just typing "fwbuilder"
    on the shell prompt:
  </p>

  <p class="command">
    $ fwbuilder
  </p>

  <p>
    The program starts and opens main window and greeting dialog. The
    dialog provides links to the project web site where you can find
    more tutorials, FAQ, Firewall Builder CookBoook and other
    documentation, as well as bug tracking system and links to user
    forums and mailing list. Clicking on the link in the dialog opens
    corresponding web page in your web browser. This works the same on
    all supported OS: Linux, Windows and Mac OS X. You can always open
    this dialog later using an item in the main menu "Help".
  </p>

  <img src="pict_010.png">

  <p>
    Lets create our first firewall object. To do this, we'll use
    object creation menu that appears when you click on the icon in
    the small toolbar right above the object tree. Choose menu item
    "New Firewall" from the menu that appears.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_020.png">

  <p>
    The program presents wizard-like dialog that will guide you
    through the process of creation of the new firewall object.  In
    the first page of the wizard you can enter the name for the new
    firewall object (here it is "guardian"), its platform ("iptables")
    and host OS ("Linux").
  </p>

  <p>
    There are two ways new firewall can be created: you can use one of
    the preconfigured template firewall objects or create it from
    scratch. This tutotiral demonstrates the first method (using
    template object). To do this, check checkbox "Use preconfigured
    template firewall objects". Template can be taken from the library
    of template objects that comes with Firewall Builder package or
    from a file provided by the user. The latter is useful when
    administrator wants to distribute a library of predefined
    templates to other users in the enterprise. We are using one of
    the standard templates in this guide and therefore leave
    standard template library path and name in the "Template file:"
    input field. Click "Next" to move on to the next page of the
    wizard.
  </p>

  <p>
    Note that template firewall object comes completely configured,
    including addresses and netmasks of its interfaces and some basic
    policy and NAT rules. This configuration is intended as a starting
    point only. You should reconfigure addresses of interfaces to
    match those used on your network and most likely will have to
    adjust rules to match your security policy.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_030.png">

  <p>
    This page of the wizard shows template objects and their
    configuration. Standard template objects represent firewalls with
    two or three interfaces, a host with one interface, web server or
    Cisco router. Choose firewall with three interfaces for this
    guide. Note that template comes with completely configured
    firewall object, including set of interfaces and their ip
    addresses and some basic firewall policy. You will see how
    addresses can be changed later on in this guide. Click "Finish" to
    create a new firewall object using chosen template.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_040.png">

  <p>
    Here is our new firewall object. Its name is <b>guardian</b>, it
    appears in the object tree in the left hand side of the main
    window in the folder <b>Firewalls</b>. When an object is selected
    in the tree, a brief summary of its properties appears in the
    panel under the tree. Double-clicking on the object in the tree
    opens it in the editor panel at the bottom of the right hand side
    panel of the main window. The editor for the firewall object
    allows the user to change its name, platform and host OS and also
    provides buttons that open dialogs for "advanced" settings for the
    firewall platform and host OS. We will inspect these little later
    in this tutorial.
  </p>

  <p>
    Unfortunately not all columns of the policy view fit in the
    screenshot because of the limitations on the size of the
    images. You can always resize the main window to make it bigger.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now would be a good time to save the data to a disk file. This is
    done in a usual way ising main menu <b>File/Save As</b>.
