  <h2>Getting Started with Firewall Builder - Page 3</h2>


  <p>
    Lets look at the IP address of the internal interface of the
    firewall. The address used in the template is "192.168.1.1" with
    netmask "255.255.255.0". This is rather typical address used for
    small and home networks. Some commercial firewall appliances come
    preconfigured with this address.
  </p>

  <p>
    If address <b>192.168.1.0/24</b> matches address of your local
    network, you can skip this part of the guide and move to the page
    4. Otherwise, you need to reconfigure the address of the internal
    interface of the firewall object that you just created in
    fwbuilder and also change address object used in the policy
    rules. Start with changing address attribute (and possibly
    netmask, if necessary) of the object <b>guardian:eth1:ip</b> as
    shown in the screenshot:
  </p>

  <p>
    Now we need to change IP address used in the rules. To do this, we
    create new Network object with correct address and replace object
    <b>net-192.168.1.0</b> in all rules with this new network object.
  </p>

  <p>
    Use new object menu to create Network object.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_170.png">

  <p>
    New Network object is created with default name 'New Network' and
    IP address 0.0.0.0.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_180.png">

  <p>
    Edit object name and address, then hit "Apply".
  </p>

  <img src="pict_190.png">

  <p>
    Use menu Object / Find to activate search and replace dialog. The
    Find and Replace dialog opens at the bottom of the right hand side
    panel in the main window, below the policy rules view.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_200.png">

  <p>
    Locate object object <b>net-192.168.1.0</b> in any policy rule
    where it is used or in its location in the tree in
    library <b>Standard</b> and drag and drop it to the left object
    well in the search and replace dialog as shown on the screenshot:
  </p>
  
  <img src="pict_210.png">
  
  <p>
    Change the scope setting to "Policy of all firewalls". If you have
    many firewalls in the tree, use scope "policy of the opened
    firewall" instead.  Locate new Network object you just created in
    the tree and drag and drop it to the right object well in the
    search and replace dialog as shown on the screenshot:
  </p>

  <img src="pict_220.png">
  
  <p>
    NOw hit "Replace all" button. Pop-up dialog should appear and
    report how many replacemens the program had to make in all rules
    of the firewall. Note that the replacement is done not only in the
    policy rules, but in NAT rules as well.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_230.png">
  
  <p>
    Now that you have created a new object and replaced old network
    object with new one in all rules, do not forget to save data to a
    file using menu <b>File/Save</b>
  </p>
