  <h2>Getting Started with Firewall Builder - Page 2</h2>

  <p>
    Lets take a little tour of the network and service objects that
    come standard with the program. You can use these preconfigured
    objects to build policy and NAT rules for your firewall.
  </p>

  <p>
    Objects in the tree are orginized in libraries, you can switch
    between libraries usinf drop-down menu above the tree. Firewall
    Builder comes with a collection of address, network, service and
    time interval objects in the library called "Standard". Lets take
    a look at them. Notice that the background color of the panel that
    shows objects tree depends on the chosen object library. This
    makes it easier to keep track of the library currently opened in
    the program. 
  </p>

  <img src="pict_060.png">

  <p>
    Folder <b>Objects/Hosts</b> contains few host objects used in
    standard firewall templates. Folder <b>Objects/Network</b>
    contains network objects that represent various standard address
    ranges and blocks, such as multicast, net 127/8, networks defined
    in RFC1918 and so on.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_070.png">

  <p>
    Firewall Builder also comes with extensive collection of TCP, UDP
    and ICMP service objects that describe commonly used
    protocols. This slide shows some TCP objects (all of them do not
    fit in the screenshot).
  </p>

  <img src="pict_080.png">

  <p>
    Here is an example of a simple TCP service. It defines source and
    destination port ranges (in this case source port range is not
    defined and there is only one destination port 80). TCP service
    object can also define any combination of tcp flags the firewall
    should inspect and also which ones of them should be set in order
    for a packet to match this object. In the case of the service
    "http" we do not need to define any flags.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_090.png">

  <p>
    Now lets take a look at the objects created as part of the new
    firewall object <b>guardian</b>. In order to do this, switch to
    the library <b>User</b> where this object was created. To open an
    object in the editor panel to inspect or change it, double click
    on it in the tree. Also, if you click on an object in the policy
    rule to select it, it will automatically open in the tree on the
    left.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_100.png">

  <p>
    First, the firewall object itself.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every object in fwbuilder has basic attributes such as its name
    and comment. Other attributes depend on the object type.
  </p>

  <p>
    Attributes of the firewall object include platform (can be
    iptables, pf, ipfilter, etc.), version (platform-depended) and
    host OS. Buttons <b>Host OS Settings</b> and <b>Firewall
    Settings</b> open dialogs with many additional attributes that
    depend on the firewall platform and host OS. More on these later.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_110.png">

  <p>
    Here are the choices for the firewall platform, version (for
    iptables) and host OS.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_103.png">

  <p>
    Interfaces of the firewall are represented by objects located
    below the Firewall object in the tree. We refer to them as
    "children" of the firewall object. This slide demonstrates
    properties of the interface eth0. To open it in the editor double
    click on it in the tree. If editor panel is already open and shows
    some object, it is sufficient to select new object in the tree to
    reveal it in the editor panel (no need to double click).
  </p>

  <p>
    IP and MAC addresses of interfaces are represented by child
    objects in the tree located below corresponding interface.
  </p>

  <img src="pict_120.png">

  <p>
    Interface object has several attributes that define its function,
    such as "Management interface", "external" etc.
  </p>

  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Name: the name of the interface object in Firewall Builder must
        match exactly the name of the interface of the firewall machine it
        represents. This will be something like "eth0", "eth1", "en0", "br0"
        and so on.</li>

      <li>Label: On most OS this ﬁeld is not used and serves the purpose of
        a descriptive label. Firewall Builder GUI uses a label, if it is not
        blank, to show interfaces in the tree. One of the suggested uses for
        this ﬁeld is to mark interfaces to reﬂect the network topology
        (’outside’, ’inside’) or the purpose (’web frontend’ or ’backup
        subnet’). The label is mandatory for Cisco PIX though, where it must
        reﬂect the network topology.</li>

      <li>"Management interface": Sometimes the host has several network
        interfaces in which case one of them can be marked as the ’manaagement
        interface’. The management interface is used for all communication
        between Firewall Builder and the host.</li>

      <li>"External interface (insecure)": marks an interface that connects
        to the Internet.</li>

      <li>"Unprotected interface": marks interface to which fwbuilder should
        not assign any access lists (used only with Cisco IOS platform)</li>

      <li>"Regular Interface": Use this option if the interface has an IP
        address assigned to it manually.</li>

      <li>"Address is assigned dynamically": Use this option if the
        interface has a dynamic address (obtained by means of DHCP or PPP or
        another protocol); in this case an address is unknown at the moment
        when Firewall Builder generates the ﬁrewall policy. </li>

      <li>"Unnumbered interface": Use this option if the interface can never
        have an IP address, such as the ethernet interface used to run PPPoE
        communication on some ADSL connections, tunnel endpoint interface, or
        an interface on a bridging ﬁrewall. See below Section 5.3.1 for more
        detailed discussion of these different types of interfaces. </li>

      <li>"Bridge port": this option is used for port of bridged firewall.</li>

      <li>"Security level": security level of this interface, used only with
        Cisco PIX (ASA)</li>

      <li>"Network zone": network zone of this interface, used only with
        Cisco PIX (ASA). Network zone drop-down list shows all network obejcts
        and groups of addresses and networks present in the tree. Choose one
        of them to tell the compiler which networks and blocks of addresses
        can be reached through this interface. Compiler uses this information
        to decide which interface each ACL rule should be associated with
        based on the addresses used in the destination of the rule.</li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <img src="pict_130.png">

  <p>
    Here is IP address of interface eth0, external interface of the
    firewall. The address and netmask are attributes of the child
    object of the type "IPv4 address". Here the address is "192.0.2.1"
    and netmask "255.255.255.0". Button "DNS Lookup" can be used to
    determine ip address using DNS. The program runs DNS query for the
    "A" record for the name of the parent firewall object.
