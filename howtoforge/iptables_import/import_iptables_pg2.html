    <h2>Importing iptables configurations into Firewall Builder</h2>

        <p>
          The next window shows a preview of the configuration file that will be 
          imported and the type of firewall that Firewall Builder has detected it 
          to be.
        </p>

        <p>
          Next you need to enter a name for the firewall. This is the name that will 
          be used in Firewall Builder to refer to the firewall after it is imported. When 
          you click the <b>Commit</b> button the configuration data will be read.
        </p>

        <p>
          By default, Firewall Builder attempts to detect if there are items, like IP 
          addresses, used in the rules that match existing items in the object tree. 
          If there is a match the existing item is used, if there is no match a new 
          object is created. This feature can be disabled by unchecking the box next 
          to "Find an use existing objects" which will result in objects being 
          created for evry item used in the imported rules regardless of whether it 
          already exists in the object tree or not.
        </p>

        <p>
          After the import is complete, Firewall Builder displays a log showing 
          all the actions that were taken during the import. Warning messages are 
          displayed in blue font and Error messages are displayed in red.
        </p>

        <p>
          The program tries to interpret the configuration file rule by rule 
          and recreates the equivalent rule in Firewall Builder. Note that 
          rules imported into Firewall Builder may not always be optimized 
          since features like defining multiple source and/or destinations 
          are supported by Firewall Builder, but not by iptables.
        </p>

        <p>
          The progress window displays warning and error messages, if any, 
          as well as some diagnostics that shows network and service objects 
          created in the process. 
        </p>

        <p>
         As you can see from the import process log, Firewall Builder detected 
         that there are rules in the iptables configuration that allow RELATED 
         and ESTABLISHED traffic through the firewall. This behavior can be 
         controlled by a setting in Firewall Builder, so a warning message is 
         shown.
        </p>

        <p>
          Click the <b>Done</b> button to complete the firewall import. Next 
          we will go through some common post-import actions.
        </p>
